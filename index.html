<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Democratic Architecture: Practical Solutions to Today&#39;s Housing Crisis</h2><p>Finally comes a book that grapples with the complex realities of the housing crisis in the United States. Architect Donald MacDonald provides an astute critique of the various approaches to postwar housing, and then puts forth a number of his own innovative, prototypical solutions to the problem. MacDonald&#39;s proposal for democratic architecture are based on four principles: that every human being has a right to an affordable home; that people should be able to manipulate their residential environments, for expanding and dividing spaces to changing facades easily and inexpensively; that in deciding where and how to construct housing every effort be made to prevent damage to the environment; and last, that residential design must express the multiplicity of society, not some ideal or political ideology. Many of his proposals are practical designs for low- and lower-middle-income housing, with an emphasis on increasing opportunities for home ownership. They include a variety of detached homes, multiunit buildings, and some alternative types of housing for people whose lifestyles diverge from the mainstream. Here you will find tested, workable schemes - not pipe dreams - that go a long way in addressing the housing crisis. Written in an engaging, straightforward style, Democratic Architecture is required reading for urban planners, policymakers, and social scientists - as well as architecture and design professionals.</p><p>DONALD MACDONALD, FAIA is an internationally recognized architect and principal of MacDonald Architects in San Francisco. He is known as a visionary, an iconoclast, someone who believes passionately in the concept of &#34;home,&#34; and of every human being&#39;s right to a home -- not just a shelter, but in fact a beautifully designed functional space. He cares deeply about making housing affordable, finding ways to turn homeless people and families with marginal incomes into homeowners, combating NIMBYism, putting housing and offices on top of shopping center parking lots to fight suburban sprawl and automobile gridlock, designing living spaces that provide the crucial element of privacy, and working with community groups. MacDonald studied architecture at Columbia University. His work has ranged from designing luxury homes in Napa Valley and Marin County, to a mixed use residential community for Asian immigrants in Oakland, modern condominiums in San Francisco, day care centers, and small functional shelters for homeless (known as &#34;City Sleepers&#34;). He received the 1989 Community Assistance Award from the California Council of the AIA. His Frank G. Mar Community Housing Mixed Use Project has received the 1990 World Habitat Award awarded by the Building and Social Housing Foundation (England) at the United Nations 1991 World Habitat Day and the National Endowment for the Arts&#39; 1991 Federal Design Achievement Award. MacDonald has also been honored with the 1996 and 1997 HUD Award for Building Innovation in Home Ownership, as well as the City of Vision Award from the International Making Cities Livable organization. His work has been widely published in national and international publications. He is a passionate speaker and has lectured all over the world on the complex realities of the housing crisis in the United States.In democratic architecture, there are no such rules, no preconceived and inflexible notions of how much space a worker or anybody else needs or should have, and certainly no attempt to bring liberty by means of order. The goal is to provide people with a private, secure, and congenial place to live at an affordable cost. That means creating space that they can control and dominate, instead of being dominated by it. Unlike the peasant Pakhom [in Leo Tolstoy&#39;s &#34;How Much Land Does a Man Need?&#34;], they should not have to keep looking elsewhere and moving on to obtain more space as their needs increase and fortunes wax. A home should be alive; it should grow and change, and as it matures, gain a distinct personality.</p><h2>Forgotten Modern: California Houses 1940-1970</h2><p><p>Forgotten Modern reveals the work of the innovative architects building in California from the 1930s to the 1970s. With groundbreaking and illuminating examples that will alter the way we think of California architecture, Hess and Weintraub focus on those that exemplify early mid-entury modern, variations on minimalism, and organic architecture.</p> <p> Though architects, historians, and the public alike have overlooked many of these superb architects from California's past century, this book intends to bring them back to our attention. All the architects included here are important in helping to show the breadth of design, that styles like Organic were more widely represented than we have previously realized, and that the fertile soil of California design fostered a wide spectrum of remarkable ideas-even if not all developed a significant school of followers. </p> <p>Chapters Include:</p> <ul><li>A New Introduction to Midcentury California</li> <li>Searching For Midcentury Modern</li> <li>Variations on Wood and Steel Modernism</li> <li>Organic Architecture</li> <li>History Plus Modernism</li> </ul></p><p>Forgotten Modern: California Houses 1940-1970 reveals the work of such extraordinary but often unheralded architects as Jack Hillmer, William Krisel, Beverley David Thorne, A. E. Morris, Fred and Lois Langhorst, and Charles Warren Callister. Through an exploration of Midcentury Modern architecture, variations on minimalism, and Organic architecture, this book offers empirical evidence that the buildings designed and built in midcentury California ranged far beyond what we have so far believed. In the 1950s Eero Saarinen (and many others) criticized the "unchecked emotionalism" of the Bay Area's woodsy architecture, but Jack Hillmer's complex structures expressed in sensuous redwood go far beyond sentimental taste. The innovative use of history in Warren Callister and Millard Sheets's architecture undermines the theory that the past must be jettisoned if we wish to be "honest" about today. California's deeply rooted Organic tradition reveals a Modernism that is often wonderfully opulent rather than starkly minimal. The complex spaces of Allyn Morris, the fertile formal imagination of Lamont Langworthy, the early explorations of "Modern" conducted by Paul Williams, Clarence Mayhew, Allen Siple, and Theodore Criley show Modernism to be an ongoing invitation to experiment, not a preordained result. All of these architects-and many more-deserve to be included in a new picture of the stimulating variety of California design. <br> Alan Weintraub is a widely published architectural photographer whose books include Frank Lloyd Wright: The Houses; Lloyd Wright: The Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright Jr.; The Architecture of John Lautner; Oscar Niemeyer Houses; Rancho Deluxe: Rustic Dreams and Real Western Living; Organic Architecture: The Other Modernism; as well as an ongoing work on the modern residential architecture of Brazil. He lives in San Francisco and Rio de Janeiro.<br> Alan Hess is an architect, architecture critic for the San Jose Mercury News, and author of more than a dozen books that explore new facets of twentieth-century architecture. His books include Oscar Niemeyer Houses; Googie Redux: Ultramodern Roadside Architecture; The Ranch House; Palm Springs Weekend: The Architecture and Design of a Midcentury Oasis; Frank Lloyd Wright: The Houses; The Architecture of John Lautner; Organic Architecture: The Other Modernism; and others. He resides in Irvine, California. <br><p>Alan Hess is an architect and historian who has written nine books documenting the architectural history of the West's suburban metropolises (including Frank Lloyd Wright: The Houses; The Ranch House; Viva Las Vegas; and The Architecture of John Lautner). He has served as architecture critic for the San Jose Mercury News since 1986. He studied at UCLA's Graduate School of Architecture and Urban Planning, and has been active in the preservation of roadside and post-War architecture, qualifying the nation's oldest McDonald's drive-in, the 1947 Bullock's Pasadena department store, the 1956 Valley Ho Motor Inn in Scottsdale, among others, for the National Register of Historic Places. He received a 1997 Honor Award from the National Trust for Historic Preservation for his efforts to preserve the McDonald's. Hess has taught at the Southern California Institute of Architecture (SciArc) and UCLA. He lives in Irvine, California.</p><br><br>Alan Weintraub is a widely published architectural photographer whose books include Frank Lloyd Wright: The Houses; Lloyd Wright: The Architecture of FLW, Jr.; The Architecture of John Lautner; Oscar Niemeyer: Houses; Rancho Deluxe: Rustic Dreams and Real Western Living, as well as an ongoing work on the modern residential architecture of Brazil.</p><h2>Stephanie&#39;s Ponytail (Munsch for Kids)</h2><p>None of the kids in her class wear a ponytail, so Stephanie decides she must have one. The loud, unanimous comment from her classmates is: Ugly, ugly, very ugly.&#x201d; Steadfast, when all the girls have copied her ponytail, she resolves to try a new style. With true Munsch flair, each of Stephanie&#x2019;s ponytails is more outrageous than the last, while the cast of copycats grows and grows.</p><p><p> <b>Robert Munsch</b> is the author of more than 25 books for children including <i>The Paper Bag Princes</i> and <i>Stephanie's Ponytail.</i> He was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and studied to be a Jesuit priest before deciding to work with children instead. He taught in a variety of nursery schools and daycare centers while he earned an MA in Early Childhood Education. In 1975, Munsch and his wife, Ann, moved to Guelph, Ontario. The Munschs have three children: Julie, Andrew, and Tyya (see them all in <i>Something Good!</i>). </p><p> <b>Michael Martchenko</b> has illustrated over 30 books for children and has exhibited his work throughout North America. He has won numerous awards for design and illustration. He lives with his wife, Patricia, in Toronto. </p>Grade 1-3-"Ugly, ugly, very ugly," decrees the class when Stephanie arrives in school with a ponytail. But the next day, all the girls have ponytails, too. Dismayed and disgusted by these copycats, Stephanie has her Mom move her ponytail to one side with the same results. After wearing it top and front as well, Stephanie confronts the class with her final act of defiance-she announces that she's going to shave her head! Next day, her teacher and classmates are bald as billiard balls and Stephanie? Why, she's chased from the classroom with her very ordinary ponytail flying out behind her. Munsch lampoons the slavish conformity of kids while applauding Stephanie's courage and audacity in this thinly disguised paean to individualism. The cumulative text and progressively more unusual hairstyles will appeal to young readers, and the turnabout ending is satisfying if not surprising. Students of all genders, races, body types, and ages are equally subject to ridicule. The blatant hostility to Stephanie's creative coiffures is never explained, however, and her unholy glee when escaping the rampaging mob of bald classmates borders on malicious. The text is presented opposite the full-page watercolor illustrations that are suitably cartoonish and silly. Independent readers will notice the funny details, such as pets with ponytails. While too small for use with large groups, this book could spark a lively discussion if read aloud. Predictable, irreverent Munsch.<br><i>Carol Ann Wilson, Westfield Memorial Library, </i><br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Atlas Obscura: An Explorer&#39;s Guide to the World&#39;s Hidden Wonders</h2><p>Inspiring equal parts wonder and wanderlust, Atlas Obscura takes readers off the beaten path and celebrates over 600 of the most curious and unusual destinations around the globe.

John Weaver is serving God in a war-torn country that is being blamed for the terrorist acts on American soil. Despite the fact that every day is dangerous and possibly life-threatening, John Weaver believes he sees God at work in Afghanistan and he is optimistic about its spiritual future. <i>Inside Afghanistan</i> is the story of the Taliban and September 11, as only this servant of God can tell it. John Weaver was there as the last American aid worker in the hostile country he now calls home. He is witness to God's ability to use ordinary Christians in the U.S. to "spread the Gospel of Jesus Christ to a country that otherwise wouldn't have had the opportunity." This is John Weaver's riveting account of why he went and why he wouldn't leave.</p></p><p>John Weaver grew up in Northern Virginia and received a B.A. degree from Free Will Baptist Bible College in 1993, a Master&#39;s Degree in Inter-Cultural Studies from Columbia International University, and a TESOL (Teaching English as a Second Language) certificate from Trinity Thailand in 1999.

Weaver&#39;s goal is to provide relief and development projects/programs that please God - to model love, excellence and service and improve the quality of life of the Afghans in Badakhshan/Takhar Provinces of N.E Afghanistan.</p><h2>Conversation in the Cathedral (English and Spanish Edition)</h2><p><p><b>A Haunting tale of power, corruption,<br> and the complex search for identity</b></p> <p><b>Conversation in The Cathedral</b> takes place in 1950s Peru during the dictatorship of Manuel A. Odr�a. Over beers and a sea of freely spoken words, the conversation flows between two individuals, Santiago and Ambrosia, who talk of their tormented lives and of the overall degradation and frustration that has slowly taken over their town.</p> <p>Through a complicated web of secrets and historical references, Mario Vargas Llosa analyzes the mental and moral mechanisms that govern power and the people behind it. More than a historic analysis, <b>Conversation in The Cathedral</b> is a groundbreaking novel that tackles identity as well as the role of a citizen and how a lack of personal freedom can forever scar a people and a nation.</p></p><p><p>Mario Vargas Llosa, uno de los m�s destacados novelistas contempor�neos latinoamericanos, se lanz� a la fama con su novela<em> La ciudad y los perros</em> que obtuvo el Premio Biblioteca Breve y el Premio de la Cr�tica.

First the head of the family, Sir Roger, is killed in a riding accident; then his young son John is found dead, his poor body horrifically beaten. Although the small West Country community is eager to believe his death was an unfortunate accident, it soon becomes clear that the truth is far more disturbing. This, the seventh mystery featuring Sir Baldwin Furnshill and Simon Puttock, is another absorbing medieval &#34;whodunit.&#34;</p><p>Michael Jecks gave up a career in the computer industry to concentrate on writing and the study of medieval history, especially that of Devon and Cornwall. He and his wife now live in northern Dartmoor..The medieval era is a popular setting for mysteries these days, as evidenced by these three new titles. Clare introduces a new heroine, the exemplary Abbess of Hawkenlye, who must join forces with an emissary from Richard Plantagenet to solve the murder of first one and then two young nuns. The ending is a little limp, but the writing is fine, and the abbess is an engaging character, one of the few religious in such mysteries (along with Sister Fidelma) actually to be presented in a positive light. Wolf brings back the hero of No Dark Place, Hugh de Leon, who in his first mystery discovered that he was heir to the Earl of Wiltshire. Hugh is determined to marry his feisty beloved despite opposition from the earl and is subsequently caught up in investigating the murder of the father of the bride the earl intends for him. The cool, savvy Hugh is almost too good to be true, and the psychic communication between him and his true love doesn't seem to fit with the otherwise realistically detailed surrounds, but the plot moves along quite nicely and should entertain most fans. Over the last few years. the publisher has been releasing Jecks's series featuring Sir Baldwin Furnshill, Keeper of the King's Peace in 14th-century England, in an attractive little mass-market format. Like all Jecks's tales, this one--concerning the suspicious death of the new master of Throwleigh, a five-year-old boy--is nicely detailed and tightly argued, with involving action and memorable characters. The whole series belongs in any collection where historicals are popular.<br><i>-Barbara Hoffert, "Library Journal" </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Narrative of Hosea Hudson: His Life as a Negro Communist in the South</h2><p>Painter&#39;s oral biography of the Black activist recreates in detail Hudson&#39;s life in the Birmingham steel mills, his active participation in the Communist Party, and his presidency of a CIO union local during the 1930s</p><p></p><h2>Space-Time and Beyond</h2><p>Captioned cartoon drawings offering an overview of universal order as they deal with various phenomena are combined with scientific commentary</p><p></p><h2>Ukraine: A Historical Atlas (University of Toronto Ukrainian Studies)</h2><p>This atlas is one response to the practical demand for university-level and advanced secondary pedagogical materials related to Ukranian subjects.</p><p><p>'The pages of historical commentary accompanying each map are exceptionally well-written and supply a wealth of information...those interested in gaining a more thorough understanding of Ukraine and its history will find this atlas a rich resource of information and would do well to consult it.'</p>Paul Robert Magocsi is a professor in the Department of History and the Department of Political Science and the chair of the Ukrainian Studies Program at the University of Toronto.</p><h2>Lilies of the Hearth: The Historical Relationship Between Women and Plants</h2><p><p> Harrowsmith gardening editor Jennifer Bennett travels "the sweetly scented, dangerous, romantic path women share with plants" and discovers a world rich in myth, magic, scientific curiosity and entrepreneurial spirit. </p></p><p>Jennifer BennettIn tracing the history of female involvement with plants, Bennett (gardening editor of Harrowsmith magazine) suggests that in ancient times this relationship was a source of strength for women, in their roles as herbal healers, food providers, and, symbolically, fertility and nature goddesses. Over the past several centuries this bond weakened, as herbalists were condemned as witches and upper-class women gave up dirt gardening for fey crafts like wax-flower making. Only recently have women regained some stature as botanists, horticulturalists, garden designers, artists, and writers. Bennett also discusses topics such as convent gardens, pioneer women and their gardens, and hallucinogenic drugs used by "witches." This interesting book would be a fine addition to women's studies, as well as general collections.<br><i>- Beth Clewis, J. Sargeant Reynolds Community Coll.

Thorp, best known for The Detective, has written a desultory story about the fallout from an apparent drug murder in Los Angeles that ultimately points to corruption at the top of the L.A.P.D., corruption that becomes an obsession for homicide detective Mike Gallagher when his longtime partner is murdered. With the murder, the novel finally begins to move forward with some energy and passion, but this comes very late in the game. Although Gallagher, a tough guy with a soft heartprototype of the new herois a strong character, Thorp has filled the book with many less-memorable actors, especially an endless array of indistinguishable villains.

The answer, luckily, is simple: yep. A magnificent spectacle more than worth the price of admission, <i>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</i> will blow you away. However, given that so much has gone into protecting the secrets of the book (including armored trucks and injunctions), don't expect any spoilers in this review. It's much more fun not knowing what's coming--and in the case of Rowling's delicious sixth book, you don't want to know. Just sit tight, despite the earth-shattering revelations that will have your head in your hands as you hope the words will rearrange themselves into a different story. But take one warning to heart: do not open <i>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</i> until you have first found a secluded spot, safe from curious eyes, where you can tuck in for a good long read. Because once you start, you won't stop until you reach the very last page. <p> A darker book than any in the series thus far with a level of sophistication belying its genre, <i>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</i> moves the series into murkier waters and marks the arrival of Rowling onto the adult literary scene. While she has long been praised for her cleverness and wit, the strength of Book 6 lies in her subtle development of key characters, as well as her carefully nuanced depiction of a community at war. In <i>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</i>, no one and nothing is safe, including preconceived notions of good and evil and of right and wrong. With each book in her increasingly remarkable series, fans have nervously watched J.K. Rowling raise the stakes; gone are the simple delights of butterbeer and enchanted candy, and days when the worst ailment could be cured by a bite of chocolate. A series that began as a colorful lark full of magic and discovery has become a dark and deadly war zone. But this should not come as a shock to loyal readers. Rowling readied fans with <i>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</i> and <i>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</i> by killing off popular characters and engaging the young students in battle. Still, there is an unexpected bleakness from the start of Book 6 that casts a mean shadow over Quidditch games, silly flirtations, and mountains of homework.

Keep in mind that this list is by no means exhaustive (what we love about Harry could fill ten books!) and does not include any of the spectacular revelatory moments that would spoil the books for those (few) who have not read them. Enjoy. <p><strong><i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</i></strong> <br> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> <td>* Harry's first trip to the zoo with the Dursleys, when a boa constrictor winks at him. <br>* When the Dursleys' house is suddenly besieged by letters for Harry from Hogwarts. Readers learn how much the Dursleys have been keeping from Harry. Rowling does a wonderful job in displaying the lengths to which Uncle Vernon will go to deny that magic exists. <br>* Harry's first visit to Diagon Alley with Hagrid. Full of curiosities and rich with magic and marvel, Harry's first trip includes a trip to Gringotts and Ollivanders, where Harry gets his wand (holly and phoenix feather) and discovers yet another connection to He-Who-Must-No-Be-Named. This moment is the reader's first full introduction to Rowling's world of witchcraft and wizards.<br>* Harry's experience with the Sorting Hat. </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p> <strong><i>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</i></strong> <br> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> <td>* The de-gnoming of the Weasleys' garden. Harry discovers that even wizards have chores--gnomes must be grabbed (ignoring angry protests "Gerroff me! Gerroff me!"), swung about (to make them too dizzy to come back), and tossed out of the garden--this delightful scene highlights Rowling's clever and witty genius. <br>* Harry's first experience with a Howler, sent to Ron by his mother. <br>* The Dueling Club battle between Harry and Malfoy. Gilderoy Lockhart starts the Dueling Club to help students practice spells on each other, but he is not prepared for the intensity of the animosity between Harry and Draco. Since they are still young, their minibattle is innocent enough, including tickling and dancing charms. </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p> <strong><i>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</i></strong><br> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> <td>* Ron's attempt to use a telephone to call Harry at the Dursleys'. <br>* Harry's first encounter with a Dementor on the train (and just about any other encounter with Dementors). Harry's brush with the Dementors is terrifying and prepares Potter fans for a darker, scarier book. <br>* Harry, Ron, and Hermione's behavior in Professor Trelawney's Divination class. Some of the best moments in Rowling's books occur when she reminds us that the wizards-in-training at Hogwarts are, after all, just children. Clearly, even at a school of witchcraft and wizardry, classes can be boring and seem pointless to children. <br>* The Boggart lesson in Professor Lupin's classroom. <br>* Harry, Ron, and Hermione's knock-down confrontation with Snape. </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p> <strong><i>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</i></strong><br> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> <td>* Hermione's disgust at the reception for the veela (Bulgarian National Team Mascots) at the Quidditch World Cup. Rowling's fourth book addresses issues about growing up--the dynamic between the boys and girls at Hogwarts starts to change. Nowhere is this more plain than the hilarious scene in which magical cheerleaders nearly convince Harry and Ron to jump from the stands to impress them. <br>* Viktor Krum's crush on Hermione--and Ron's objection to it. <br>* Malfoy's "Potter Stinks" badge. <br>* Hermione's creation of S.P.E.W., the intolerant bigotry of the Death Eaters, and the danger of the Triwizard Tournament. Add in the changing dynamics between girls and boys at Hogwarts, and suddenly Rowling's fourth book has a weight and seriousness not as present in early books in the series. Candy and tickle spells are left behind as the students tackle darker, more serious issues and take on larger responsibilities, including the knowledge of illegal curses.</td></tr> </tbody></table> <p> <strong><i>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</i></strong><br> </p><p> </p><table> <tbody><tr><td> </td> <td>* Harry's outburst to his friends at No. 12 Grimmauld Place. A combination of frustration over being kept in the dark and fear that he will be expelled fuels much of Harry's anger, and it all comes out at once, directly aimed at Ron and Hermione. Rowling perfectly portrays Harry's frustration at being too old to shirk responsibility, but too young to be accepted as part of the fight that he knows is coming. <br>* Harry's detention with Professor Umbridge. Rowling shows her darker side, leading readers to believe that Hogwarts is no longer a safe haven for young wizards. Dolores represents a bureaucratic tyrant capable of real evil, and Harry is forced to endure their private battle of wills alone. <br>* Harry and Cho's painfully awkward interactions. Rowling clearly remembers what it was like to be a teenager. <br>* Harry's Occlumency lessons with Snape. <br>* Dumbledore's confession to Harry.</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p> </p><p> <strong>Magic, Mystery, and Mayhem: A Conversation with J.K.

J.K. Rowling is very descriptive in her writing--she gives an illustrator a lot to work with. Each story is packed full of rich visual descriptions of the atmosphere, the mood, the setting, and all the different creatures and people. She makes it easy for me. The images just develop as I sketch and retrace until it feels right and matches her vision."

He is the logical conclusion of many of the most dangerous trends of the past half-century. He is the personification of the merger of humans and corporations--a one-man megabrand, with wife and children as spin-off brands. This book is to help understand how we arrived at this surreal political moment, how to keep it from getting a lot worse, and how, if we keep our heads, we can flip the script and seize the opportunity to make things a whole lot better in a time of urgent need. A tool-kit for shock-resistance."&nbsp;</i>--from the Introduction<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br> The election of Donald Trump produced a frightening escalation in a world of cascading crises. The Trump Administration's vision--the deconstruction of the welfare and regulatory state, the unleashing of a fossil fuel frenzy (which requires the sweeping aside of climate science) and an all-out attack on vulnerable communities under the guise of a war on crime and terrorism--will generate wave after wave of crises and shocks around the world, to the economy, to national security, to the environment.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>In <i>No Is Not Enough</i>, Naomi Klein embraces a lively conversation with the reader to expose the forces behind Trump's success and explain why he is not an aberration but the product of our time--Reality TV branding, celebrity obsession and CEO-worship, Vegas and Guantanamo, fake news and vulture bankers all rolled into one. And she shares a bold vision, a clear-eyed perspective on how to break the spell of his shock tactics, counter the rising chaos and divisiveness at home and abroad, and win the world we need.</p><p><b>NAOMI KLEIN</b> is an award-winning journalist, syndicated columnist, and author of the international bestsellers <i>No Logo</i>, <i>The Shock Doctrine</i>, and most recently <i>This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. the Climate</i>. In 2017 she joined <i>The Intercept</i> as Senior Correspondent. In 2016 she was awarded the Sydney Peace Prize, for, according to the prize jury, "exposing the structural causes and responsibility for the climate crisis, for inspiring us to stand up locally, nationally and internationally to demand a new agenda for sharing the planet that respects human rights and equality, and for reminding us of the power of authentic democracy to achieve transformative change and justice."<b>Longlisted for the National Book Award</b><br><br>&#x201c;Absolute must-read book of the Trump era.

Like a little sun.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Emma Thompson<br><br></b>&#x201c;[A]nyone struggling for a place to even start making sense of Trump, and Trumpism, will find [this]&nbsp;book abounding in insight. . . .

And sure enough, it delivers, dissecting the Trump brand in many of its manifestations. . . . It&#x2019;s thought-provoking stuff, and is all the more remarkable because this book was written in such a hurry. . . . Like Klein&#x2019;s other books, this one brims with ideas rarely heard in the mainstream media. And her fiery, punchy writing style, which is occasionally laced with humour, makes it hard to put down.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Georgia Straight</i><br><br>&#x201c;Naomi Klein is one of the few revolutionary public intellectuals of great integrity and vision. This new book confirms her crucial relevance and essential pertinence.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;<b>Cornel West</b>, author of&nbsp;<i>Race Matters</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Urgent, timely, and necessary.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;<b>Noam Chomsky</b>, Institute Professor (Emeritus), MIT<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re wondering how Naomi Klein has managed to produce an essential and gripping book so early in the Trump presidency, it&#x2019;s because she&#x2019;s spent her whole intellectual life preparing for just this moment. Trump is the ultimate logo. Every day we watch him try to exploit yet another shock to the system. So this is the book to read&#x2014;not just the first word on Trump, but in powerful ways the last word as well.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;<b>Bill McKibben</b>, author of&nbsp;<i>Oil and Honey: The Education of an Unlikely Activist</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Klein has written an ordinary person&#x2019;s guide to hope. Read this book.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;<b>Arundhati Roy</b>, author of&nbsp;<i>The End of Imagination</i><br> &nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Naomi Klein shows us that the monstrosity of Donald Trump has not occurred in a vacuum but is the culmination of decades of unchecked economic inequality, racism, militarism, and war. As the shock of Trump as president gives way to anger and the determination to fight, <i>No Is Not Enough</i> makes an urgent intervention in emerging movements. It will take more than &#x2018;resistance&#x2019; to beat Trumpism. We need history, politics, strategy, and, most importantly, the optimism that another world is possible. Klein has made a critical contribution to the developing opposition to Trump and the economic disorder that produced him.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;<b>Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor</b>, author of&nbsp;<i>From #BlackLivesMatter to Black Liberation</i></p><h2>Masterpieces of Orientalist Art: The Shafik Gabr Collection</h2><p><table><tbody><tr><td>Shafik Gabr started his collection of Orientalist art in 1993.

That day I departed for the United States Marines.<br><br>The war with Japan was not yet four weeks old, Wake Island had fallen. Pearl Harbor was a real tragedy, a burning bitter humiliation. Hastily composed war songs were on the lips of everyone, their heavy patriotism failing to compensate for what they lacked in tune and spirit. Hysteria seemed to crouch behind all eyes.<br><br>But none of this meant much to me. I was aware of my father beside me, bending into the wind with me. I could feel the wound in my lower regions, still fresh, still sore. The sutures had been removed a few days earlier.<br><br>I had sought to enlist the day after Pearl Harbor, but the Marines had insisted that I be circumcised. It cost me a hundred dollars, although I am not sure to this day whether I paid the doctor or not. But I am certain that few young men went off to war in that fateful time so marked.<br><br>We had come across the Jersey meadows, riding the Erie commuter line, and then on the ferry over the Hudson River to downtown New York. Breakfast at home had been subdued. My mother was up and about; she did not cry. It was not a heart-rending leave-taking, nor was it brave, resolute&#x2014;any of those words that fail to describe the thing.<br><br>It was like so much else in this war that was to produce unbounded heroism, yet not a single stirring song: it was resigned. She followed me to the door with sad eyes and said, &#x201c;God keep you.&#x201d;<br><br>It had been a silent trip across the meadows and it was a wordless good-by in front of the bronze revolving doors at Ninety, Church Street. My father embraced me quickly, and just as quickly averted his face and left. The Irish doorman measured me and smiled.<br><br>I went inside and joined the United States Marines.<br><br>The captain who swore us in reduced the ceremony to a jumble. We all held up our hands. We put them down when he lowered his. That way we guessed we were marines.<br><br>The master gunnery sergeant who became our momentary shepherd made the fact plainer to us. Those rich mellow blasphemous oaths that were to become so familiar to me flowed from his lips with the consummate ease of one who had spent a lifetime in vituperation. I would meet his masters later. Presently, as he herded us across the river to Hoboken and a waiting train, he seemed to be beyond comparison. But he was gentle and kind enough when he said good-by to the thirty or forty of us who boarded the train.<br><br>He stood at the head of our railroad car&#x2014;a man of middle age, slender, and of a grace that was on the verge of being ruined by a pot belly. He wore the Marine dress blues. Over this was the regulation tight-fitting overcoat of forest green. Green and blue has always seemed to me an odd combination of colors, and it seemed especially so then; the gaudy dark and light blue of the Marine dress sheathed in sedate and soothing green.<br><br>&#x201c;Where you are going it will not be easy,&#x201d; the gunnery sergeant said. &#x201c;When you get to Parris Island, you&#x2019;ll find things plenty different from civilian life. You won&#x2019;t like it! You&#x2019;ll think they&#x2019;re overdoing things. You&#x2019;ll think they&#x2019;re stupid! You&#x2019;ll think they&#x2019;re the cruelest, rottenest bunch of men you ever ran into! I&#x2019;m going to tell you one thing. You&#x2019;ll be wrong! If you want to save yourself plenty of heartache you&#x2019;ll listen to me right now: you&#x2019;ll do everything they tell you and you&#x2019;ll keep your big mouths shut!&#x201d;<br><br>He could not help grinning at the end. No group of men ever had a saner counselor, and he knew it; but he could not help grinning. He knew we would ignore his every word.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, Sarge,&#x201d; somebody yelled. &#x201c;Thanks, Sarge.&#x201d;<br><br>He turned and left us.<br><br>We called him &#x201c;Sarge.&#x201d; Within another twenty-four hours we would not dare address a lowly Pfc. without the cringing &#x201c;sir.&#x201d; But today the civilian shine was still upon us. We wore civvies; Hoboken howled around us in the throes of trade; we each had the citizen&#x2019;s polite deprecation of the soldier, and who among us was not certain that he was not long for the ranks?<br><br>Our ride to Washington was silent and uneventful. But once we had arrived in the capital and had changed trains the atmosphere seemed to lift. Other Marine recruits were arriving from all over the east. Our contingent was the last to arrive, the last to be crammed aboard the ancient wooden train that waited, puffing, dirty-in-the-dark, smelling of coal&#x2014;waited to take us down the coast to South Carolina. Perhaps it was because of the dilapidated old train that we brightened and became gay. Such a dingy, tired old relic could not help but provoke mirth. Someone pretended to have found a brass plate beneath one of the seats, and our car rocked with laughter as he read, &#x201c;This car is the property of the Philadelphia Museum of American History.&#x201d; We had light from kerosene lamps and heat from a potbellied stove. Draughts seemed to stream from every angle and there was a constant creaking and wailing of wood and wheels that sounded like an endless keening. Strange old train that it was, I loved it.<br><br>Comfort had been left behind in Washington. Some of us already were beginning to revel in the hardship of the train ride. That intangible mystique of the marine was somehow, even then, at work. We were having it rough, which is exactly what we expected and what we had signed up for. That is the thing: having it rough. The man who has had it roughest is the man to be most admired. Conversely, he who has had it the easiest is the least praiseworthy.<br><br>Those who wished to sleep could cat-nap on the floor while the train lurched down through Virginia and North Carolina. But these were few. The singing and the talk were too exciting.<br><br>The boy sitting next to me&#x2014;a handsome blond-haired youth from south Jersey&#x2014;turned out to have a fine high voice. He sang several songs alone. There being a liberal leavening of New York Irish among us, he was soon singing Irish ballads.<br><br>Across the aisle there was another boy, whom I shall call Armadillo because of his lean and pointed face. He was from New York and had attended college there. Being one of the few college men present, he had already established a sort of literary clique.<br><br>The Armadillo&#x2019;s coterie could not equal another circle farther down the car. This had at its center a stocky, smiling redhead. Red had been a catcher for the St. Louis Cardinals and had once hit a home run at the Polo Grounds off the great Carl Hubbell.<br><br>There was no measuring the impact of such a celebrity on our group, composed otherwise of mediocrities like myself. Red had been in the big time. He had held daily converse with men who were nothing less than the idols of his newfound comrades. It was quite natural they should ring him round; consult him on everything from pitching form to the Japanese General Staff.<br><br>&#x201c;Whaddya think it&#x2019;ll be like at Parris Island, Red?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, Red&#x2014;you think the Japs are as tough as the newspapers say they are?&#x201d;<br><br>It is an American weakness. The success becomes the sage. Scientists counsel on civil liberty; comedians and actresses lead political rallies; athletes tell us what brand of cigarette to smoke. But the redhead was equal to it. It was plain in his case what travel and headlines can do. He was easily the most poised of us all.<br><br>But I suspect even Red&#x2019;s savoir-faire got a rude jolt when we arrived in Parris Island. We had been taken from the railroad station by truck. When we had dismounted and had formed a motley rank in front of the red brick mess hall, we were subjected to the classic greeting.<br><br>&#x201c;Boys,&#x201d; said the sergeant who would be our drill instructor. &#x201c;Boys&#x2014;Ah want to tell yawl something. Give youah hearts to Jesus, boys&#x2014;cause youah ass belongs to me!&#x201d;<br><br>Then he fell us in after our clumsy civilian fashion and marched us into the mess hall.<br><br>There were baloney and lima beans. I had never eaten lima beans before, but I did this time; they were cold.<br><br>The group that had made the trip from New York did not survive the first day in Parris Island. I never saw the blond singer again, nor most of the others. Somehow sixty of us among the hundreds who had been aboard that ancient train, became a training platoon, were assigned a number and placed under the charge of the drill sergeant who had delivered the welcoming address.<br><br>Sergeant Bellow was a southerner with a fine contempt for northerners. It was not that he favored the southerners; he merely treated them less sarcastically. He was big. I would say six feet four inches, two hundred thirty pounds.<br><br>But above all he had a voice.<br><br>It pulsed with power as he counted the cadence, marching us from the administration building to the quartermaster&#x2019;s. It whipped us, this ragged remnant, and stiffened our slouching civilian backs. Nowhere else but in the Marine Corps do you hear that peculiar lilting cadence of command.<br><br>&#x201c;Thrip-faw-ya-leahft, thrip-faw-ya-leahft.&#x201d;<br><br>It sounds like an incantation; but it is merely the traditional &#x201c;three-four-your-left&#x201d; elongated by the southern drawl, made sprightly by being sung. I never heard it done better than by our sergeant. Because of this, and because of his inordinate love of drill, I have but one image of him: striding stiff-backed a few feet apart from us, arms thrust out, hands clenched, head canted back, with the whole body following and the great voice ceaselessly bellowing, &#x201c;Thrip-faw-ya-leahft, thrip-faw-ya-leahft.&#x201d;<br><br>Sergeant Bellow marched us to the quartermaster&#x2019;s. It was there we were stripped of all vestiges of personality. It is the quartermasters who make soldiers, sailors and marines. In their presence, one strips down.

It sounded, as he describes it, "like a country song with a happy ending." And yet he was still haunted by a sense that the world--or, more specifically, his country--could be better. He couldn't ignore his conviction that, in fact, the good ol' USA was in the midst of great social, environmental, and political crises--that for the first time in our history, we were being swept into a future that had no future. Where did we--here, in the land of Jeffersonian optimism and better tomorrows--go wrong? </p><p>Rather than despair, Reece turned to those who had dared to imagine radically different futures for America. What followed was a giant road trip and research adventure through the sites of America's utopian communities, both historical and contemporary, known and unknown, successful and catastrophic. What he uncovered was not just a series of lost histories and broken visionaries but also a continuing and vital but hidden idealistic tradition in American intellectual history. <i>Utopia Drive</i> is an important and definitive reconstruction of that tradition. It is also, perhaps, a new framework to help us find a genuinely sustainable way forward.</p><p>" ... an engaging exploration -- and example -- of the fruitful tunnel-visions of dreamers turned doers." - <i>Publishers Weekly</i></p></p><p><b>Erik Reece</b> is the author of<i> Lost Mountain: A Year in the Vanishing Wilderness; Radical Strip Mining and the Devastation of Appalachia</i> and <i>An American Gospel: On Family, History, and the Kingdom of God</i>.

Now he ramps up the fight and makes a persuasive case that Americans are not powerless. In <i>Unstoppable</i>, he explores the emerging political alignment of the Left and the Right against converging corporate-government tyranny.<br><br>Large segments from the progressive, conservative, and libertarian political camps find themselves aligned in opposition to the destruction of civil liberties, the economically draining corporate welfare state, the relentless perpetuation of America's wars, sovereignty-shredding trade agreements, and the unpunished crimes of Wall Street against Main Street. Nader shows how Left-Right coalitions can prevail over the corporate state and crony capitalism.<br><br>He draws on his extensive experience working with grassroots organizations in Washington and reveals the many surprising victories by united progressive and conservative forces. As a participator in, and keen observer of, these budding alliances, he breaks new ground in showing how such coalitions can overcome specific obstacles that divide them, and how they can expand their power on Capitol Hill, in the courts, and in the decisive arena of public opinion.<br><br>Americans can reclaim their right to consume safe foods and drugs, live in healthy environments, receive fair rewards for their work, resist empire, regain control of taxpayer assets, strengthen investor rights, and make bureaucrats more efficient and accountable. Nader argues it is in the interest of citizens of different political labels to join in the struggle against the corporate state that will, if left unchecked, ruin the Republic, override our constitution, and shred the basic rights of the American people.<br></p><p><b>Ralph Nader</b> is an author, a lecturer, an attorney, and an American political activist in areas of consumer and worker protection, humanitarianism, environmentalism, and democratic government. He is the best-selling author of many books, including <i>Unsafe at Any Speed</i>, a critique of the safety record of American automobile manufacturers. Nader is a four-time candidate for president of the United States, having run as the Green Party nominee in 1996 and 2000 and as an independent candidate in 2004 and 2008.<br>I read Ralph Nader for the same reasons that I read Tom Paine. He knows what he thinks, says what he means, and his courage is a lesson for us all.&#x201d; <b> Lewis Lapham</b><br><br> Thomas Jefferson fretted that, with the passing of the founding generation, the truer patriotism that he knew as the Spirit of '76' would be lost. He need not have worried. Ralph Nader has recaptured the founding faith with an inspired call for a left-right coalition of conscience on behalf of democracy, liberty, fairness and peace.&#x201d; <b> John Nichols, Washington correspondent for <i>The Nation</i> and co-author of <i>Dollarocracy</i></b><br><br>"For more than 50 years, Nader has backed the rights of citizens against the growing influence of corporations and government leaders tied closely to those businesses...The new book offers readers broad philosophical views, as well as many detailed suggestions, about how to promote and advance a growing political alliance between the left and the right that challenges the growing alliance between Big Business and Big Government."<b><i> The Charleston Gazette</i></b><br><br>"In <i>Unstoppable,</i> Ralph Nader argues that there are in fact surprising areas of convergence between the left and the right... These are profound observations... Mr. Nader rails so effectively." <b> David Asman, <i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br> Activist Nader sketches out places of 'convergence' where liberals and conservatives can start working together for the public good. [he] lists reforms with which many lawmakers would agree, including breaking up too-big-to-fail banks, protecting children from commercialism and ending corporate personhood.&#x201d; <b> <i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br><br> One of Ralph Nader's finest efforts. A bold and lucid handbook for the future.&#x201d; <b> Patti Smith</b><br><br> Conservatives and liberals both look askance at the Leviathan state and realize that promises of doing good' often obscure the reality of doing well' at taxpayer expense. Those looking for opportunities for bi-partisan cooperation should look at the nexus of statism and cronyism. <i>Unstoppable</i> shows that opposing such corruption can bring activists of the right and left together to fight side by side.&#x201d; <b> Grover Norquist</b><br><br> Ralph Nader's timely book once again makes him prescient in his insights about American politics. His against-the-grain prediction of a Left-Right alliance is not just a hope, but it is grounded in emerging evidence.&#x201d; <b> Cornel West</b><br><br> Nader at his best original, indignant, idealistic, and on the lookout for new political alliances and possibilities. A tonic for the cynicism that's poisoning the groundwater of our democracy.&#x201d; <b> Robert B. Reich, Chancellor's Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley</b><br><br> No American in recent decades has done more than Ralph Nader to construct a workable alliance between the principled Right and the sincere Left to salvage our country and our national prosperity, and <i>Unstoppable</i> outlines his vital mission.&#x201d; <b> Ron Unz, former publisher of <i>The American Conservative</i></b><br><br> <i>Unstoppable</i> is even-handed, erudite, practical and necessary. Nader harnesses his lifelong crusade for the public interest over the corporatist agenda into a treatise that is optimistic and patriotic. He demonstrably shows that effective Left-Right alliances aren't pipe dreams, but historic realities in need of strategic cultivation, for the sake of our future.&#x201d; <b> Nomi Prins, author of <i>All the Presidents' Bankers</i></b></p><h2>The Names of Jesus : Disciple&#39;s Book</h2><p>Book by Towns, Elmer L.</p><p></p><h2>Shimmeree</h2><p>Shimmeree, a lovely crystal horse, and her friends learn that they don&#39;t have to be afraid of things just because they are different.</p><p></p><h2>Olive My Love</h2><p>The beloved--but confused--pup Olive is back!

Well, equal time for stepfathers.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I almost don&#x2019;t know why I hated Val so much. He was short and hairy and didn&#x2019;t know how to wear Newworld clothes and spoke with a funny accent and used a lot of really dreeping words that nobody in Newworld had used in two hundred years. Have you ever heard anyone say &#x201c;ablutions&#x201d;? I didn&#x2019;t think so. He looked like the kind of creepazoid you&#x2019;d cross the street to avoid walking past too close to. And this guy who looks like a homeless crazydumb who&#x2019;s about to start shouting about the evil magician who planted electrodes in his brain stands there smiling gently at my mother&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and she laughs and puts her arm through his because she loves him. Uggh.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe I hated him because she loved him, although I was pretty old for that kind of doolally. I&#x2019;d turned seventeen by the time they got together, and my brother, Ran (short for Randal not Randolph), who wasn&#x2019;t quite thirteen yet, thought he was wonderful. I don&#x2019;t know what went wrong with me. It was like an evil magician had put electrodes in my brain.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret Alastrina (everyone calls me Maggie, but the full lineup is way more effective if you want to shout), there&#x2019;s no point in telling this story if you&#x2019;re not going to be honest. Okay, okay, I do know why I couldn&#x2019;t deal with Val. It was the shadows. But in Newworld, where we&#x2019;re all about science and you stop reading fairy tales about the time you learn to read (which always seemed really unfair), being afraid of shadows was silly and pathetic. Even if there were a lot of them and they didn&#x2019;t seem to be the shadow of anything. (And if they were, whatever it was had way too many legs.) So I hated him for making me silly and pathetic. That&#x2019;s scientifically logical, isn&#x2019;t it?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a while Mom made a fuss about it and tried to get us&#x2014;Val and me&#x2014;to do things together, I guess because she couldn&#x2019;t believe I wouldn&#x2019;t like him if I got to know him better. You know the kind of thing. We did the grocery shopping&#x2014;with him being as useless as it&#x2019;s humanly possible to be and me having to explain everything; why he hadn&#x2019;t starved to death before he met Mom I have no idea&#x2014;and when I got my learner&#x2019;s permit Mom was always &#x201c;Oh, take Val, I haven&#x2019;t got time right now,&#x201d; which was probably true but it was also Mom trying to make us friends. (And honestly, he was a pretty good learner driver&#x2019;s passenger. He never blew about dumb stuff&#x2014;and he didn&#x2019;t even get upset when I put the tiniest&#x2014;the tiniest&#x2014;dent in Mom&#x2019;s fender because there was this really unnecessary knob on the side of one of those big metal anti-cobey boxes and I couldn&#x2019;t see it because the front of the car was in the way. We got out and looked at it and I thought, my life is over, but all Val said was, &#x201c;I can bend that out again. Back into the driveway tonight so it&#x2019;s on the other side and she&#x2019;ll never know.&#x201d;)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mom probably couldn&#x2019;t believe what had happened to her daughter. I&#x2019;d been this disgustingly sweet, cooperative kid, always worried about everyone else (this got worse after Ran was born. I am never having kids. Moms with new babies have no life), which is to say this dreary little dreep. What started giving me my own personality finally was when I got old enough to volunteer at the Orchard Animal Shelter. I was thrilled at being allowed to shovel critter crap and scrub bowls. The self-confidence issues of a nine-year-old can be pretty weird.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#x2019;d wanted a dog since forever, but about six months after Dad died, and Mom was still trying to be extra-nice to Ran and me, especially because she was working about twenty-six hours a day and exhausted and miserable and cranky when we saw her at all, I told her I&#x2019;d found my dog. So while she gave me the old &#x201c;a dog is a big responsibility&#x201d; lecture and reminded me with lots of Mom gestures and eye contact that she was working twenty-six hours a day and backup from her was a nonstarter, her heart wasn&#x2019;t really in it. I had wanted almost every dog that came into the shelter because whatever it was it was a dog, but this time it was one of those your-eyes-meet-and-you-know-you&#x2019;re-made-for-each-other things. (My friend Laura has them about every six months with a new boy.) Clare was saving him for me while I dealt with Mom (and Ran, although Ran is fine about most things including dogs as long as they&#x2019;re not his problem). So we brought Mongo home. Mongo is short for mongrel&#x2014;we don&#x2019;t know anything about him; one of the Watchguard guys brought him to Clare&#x2014;but he&#x2019;s totally a border collie.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was maybe five months old and already crazy, and you could guess that some ordinary family hadn&#x2019;t been able to cope with a hairy attack squad caroming off the walls and trying to fetch pieces of furniture so somebody would throw them for him. Mom, even having folded on the subject of my dog, was a little worried about Mongo but Clare said I&#x2019;d cope, which made me feel better than anything ever had in my life before, certainly anything since Dad died. Mongo is also really, really happy and cheerful and loving (as well as crazy) and he was totally a good idea and just what we needed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the point is, he was my dog. We had him because I wanted a dog. I had to walk him twice a day and feed him and brush him (way too much fur. If I&#x2019;d realized, I might have tried to fall in love with something short-haired) and make sure his water bowl was clean and full and all that. Which in Mongo&#x2019;s case included a lot of remedial training, starting with SIT. Sitting to have his lead put on, sitting before he was allowed out the door, sitting before he could jump in the car, sitting before his food bowl was put down&#x2014;and the accidental swallowing of the hand holding the bowl is not allowed either. Sitting got him used to paying attention to me as something more than the hand that throws the stick and puts the food bowl on the floor. (And pets him. Mongo will lie still for as long as someone is petting him.) Then there was convincing him that eating sofa cushions wasn&#x2019;t allowed, or baseboards or shoes or origami figures that happen to fall on the floor&#x2014;he ate the best dragon I ever made and the fact that Takahiro made me a better one doesn&#x2019;t change anything&#x2014;and finding a more or less chew-proof dog bed before I spent my entire college fund replacing the ones that weren&#x2019;t chew-proof enough. I thought teaching him the long down was going to kill us both, although possibly my attention span wasn&#x2019;t up to it either.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I did it. I did it all. He barely even ate newspapers or gloves or (empty) cereal boxes after the first six months with us. I was the kind of kid who did walk the dog every day. Twice. Just getting enough exercise was a big thing with Mongo.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although having to walk the dog became my excuse for not doing stuff with my friends. I kind of stopped having friends after Dad died. Everybody but Jill. Jill hung on like&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. like a really good friend who&#x2019;d had her parents split up two years before and was not going to lose anybody else. She used to come home with me after school and walk Mongo too. I am really lucky to have Jill, although I didn&#x2019;t know it for a while. I didn&#x2019;t feel lucky.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dad died when I was ten and Ran was six, because this guy who got drunk the first night they let him out of jail for drunk driving came over the median strip on the highway in his double-muscle-macho car and killed him. The guy didn&#x2019;t kill himself until the next time they let him out of jail and he ran into a tree, but that was too late for Dad. I think I was sweet for the next several years, after almost everyone else had turned into a teenager, because I was afraid that if I wasn&#x2019;t really good maybe Mom would die too. I was young enough to believe that kind of thing, although when Ran kept asking me&#x2014;especially when he hadn&#x2019;t been good&#x2014;I always said no, it was a stupid accident and Mom was really careful. She was really careful, but Dad had been really careful too; there just wasn&#x2019;t a lot he could do about something the size of an army anti-cobey truck coming over the median strip at eighty miles per hour.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mom dated a few other guys over the years, but not very many. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have time,&#x201d; she said. She worked five and a half days a week as the office manager for an accounting firm, which meant that she should have met lots of interesting men, because every grown-up has to do their taxes, but Tennel &amp; Zeet didn&#x2019;t have the right kind of clients. I know they didn&#x2019;t have the right kind of clients because Val was one of them. Tennel &amp; Zeet had a specialty in immigrants from the Slav Commonwealth so that&#x2019;s probably why Val went to them. Mom always had pictures of us on her desk. This would be cute except that even after she had pictures of us well past the rug-rat stage she kept the really loser baby ones.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ran and I didn&#x2019;t think a lot about it at first when she said she was bringing this new guy home. She did occasionally bring guys home&#x2014;or, better, we&#x2019;d all go to a restaurant: neutral ground, and somebody else cleaned up after&#x2014;although she hadn&#x2019;t in nearly a year, so whoever he was would be a little interesting for the novelty. But by the day he came I wanted to hide the salad or lay the tablecloth (yes, a real tablecloth and in the real dining room) facedown or something, just to break the circuit, as she went zinging around the kitchen like she was the most organized person in the world, which she isn&#x2019;t. We had a joke, Ran and Mom and me, that she used up all her organization at work. But the way Mom was behaving was the first clue that Val might be more important than the other (few) guys we&#x2019;d met, so I was probably already on the wrong channel with him when the doorbell rang.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also I&#x2019;d been thinking why were we having him over for dinner for this first meeting? I like having someone else doing the cooking&#x2014;someone other than Mom (or me. Although quite sane people will come to dinner when I make my spaghetti sauce). Val didn&#x2019;t have much money&#x2014;Mom didn&#x2019;t quite say this, but I figured it out. And she wanted to show him what a happy little family we were. Well, he could have cooked us dinner, couldn&#x2019;t he? At his place.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I was feeling kind of unplugged about Mom pretending we were supposed to believe it was no big deal about this Val person coming over. And when she sang out&#x2014;and I mean sang, it was disgusting&#x2014;for me to answer the door when the bell went, I think I was going to dislike him even if he was a billionaire with a private island big enough for a wild animal sanctuary and a really cute son who was just my type.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when I opened the door&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was like there was more than just Val there. As if he was twice the size of a human person, or there were two of him, or something. It was really dark out, in spite of the porch light, and at first I couldn&#x2019;t see his face. I was frightened. I didn&#x2019;t like being frightened. I&#x2019;d been frightened about almost everything since Dad died.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And there was something wrong with Val being too big. In that first shock I don&#x2019;t think I noticed there was something wrong with the darkness&#x2014;it was February, it still got dark early, it was nearly seven p.m.&#x2014;that it was shadows. If I&#x2019;d noticed they wiggled I might have just slammed the door on him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I am Val,&#x201d; he said in his funny voice, and stepped forward and I got my first eyeful of his clothes sense, which was pretty frightening all by itself. I stepped back like he was a big ugly cobey-unit goon with a zapper and I was a homeless loophead, and now in the light of the hall I could see him plainly, see that he was short and hairy as well as having a funny voice, and I&#x2019;ve seen orangutans that wore clothes better. I didn&#x2019;t recognize Val&#x2019;s accent but that wasn&#x2019;t surprising. The Slav Commonwealth is like ninety countries, some of them no bigger than your front yard, and every one of them has its own language.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was smiling at me. It was a hopeful smile and I didn&#x2019;t like it, because it meant this dinner was important to him too, and I&#x2019;d already decided I didn&#x2019;t like him. Or his big (wiggly) shadows.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The darkness, or whatever it was, seemed to retreat a little, or maybe press itself down nearer the floor where it wasn&#x2019;t so obvious, as he stepped forward. I actually peered over his shoulder as if I was looking for someone, or maybe something, but I couldn&#x2019;t see anything, although the nearest streetlight seemed farther away than usual. I looked back at him and I thought his smile had changed. He was looking at me too hard behind the smile. I thought of all those fairy tales where once you invite the evil magician over your threshold you&#x2019;d had it. But I hadn&#x2019;t invited him. He&#x2019;d just come in, and I&#x2019;d given way. Did that count?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Probably.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey. This is Newworld. We don&#x2019;t have magicians in Newworld, evil or otherwise.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Mom&#x2019;s in the kitchen,&#x201d; I said ungraciously, but he didn&#x2019;t seem to notice the ungracious. His face lit up at the mention of Mom. As he took another step forward he made a tiny bow and waved me to go ahead of him, which I should have thought was cute but I didn&#x2019;t maybe partly because there was something freaky about the shadow of his arm against the wall&#x2014;a sudden sharp ragged line along the line of his forearm, and then just as suddenly it collapsed into the proper arm shadow like it had realized I could see it. I tried not to stare but by now I was totally creeped out and couldn&#x2019;t wait to get away from him&#x2014;but getting away meant leading him farther into my house, farther away from the door. My great-grandmom&#x2019;s quilt hangs on the other, long wall by the front door, and I put my hand on it, either like I was dizzy or like it was going to protect me. Protect us. I had a moment when I thought, I&#x2019;m not going to let this shadow man near my family: I&#x2019;m going to tell him to go away.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Too late. The evil magician was already over the threshold. And the quilt was just a quilt.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don&#x2019;t guess all of this took more than a minute. It was a long minute. It was long enough for Mom to call, &#x201c;Vaaaaaal?&#x201d; Yuck. When we went into the kitchen Mom&#x2019;s face was so bright I could hardly stand to look at it. Even Mongo liked him, although Mongo likes everybody. (Also Mongo was so thrilled with himself for staying in the dog bed till I&#x2019;d released him that nothing was going to blow his mood.) Then Ran found out that Val would listen to him about cars&#x2014;cars were Ran&#x2019;s biggest thing&#x2014;and that was pretty much it for the rest of the evening. Ran talked and Val and Mom made shiny electric eyes at each other.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once we were all sitting down and eating (Mom had made her chicken, apples, and cream, which usually only came out on birthdays) I was watching the shadows on the wall behind Val&#x2019;s chair. They were too lively and there were way too many of them. One or another of them always seemed about to turn into something...</p><h2>A Killer in the Wind</h2><p>Three years ago, working vice for the NYPD, Dan Champion uncovered a sex slavery ring run by a kingpin known only as the Fat Woman. Obsessed with bringing her down, Champion infiltrated a world of sexual obsession and perversity. He broke the case, but the case also broke him. He started taking drugs and soon began to form hallucinations a dead child prowling the streets of New York a beautiful woman named Samantha who would have given him the love he always wanted if she&#x2019;d only been real.<br><br>Now Champion is a small town detective, chasing burglars and juvenile delinquents, hanging out at the local tavern where he is romancing a waitress. The ghosts and hallucinations are finally behind him as he begins to rebuild his life. Then one night Champion is called to examine the body of a woman who has washed ashore. Yet when he looks at her face, he sees that it&#x2019;s Samantha, the woman he dreamed about long ago...a woman who doesn&#x2019;t exist.<br><br>Suddenly, Champion is haunted again, only this time it&#x2019;s by a team of expert killers who want to make sure he never finds the truth: the truth about the dead child who wanders through his imagination; the truth about the lover who inhabits his dreams; and the truth about a killer who has been on the run in the wind for a lifetime. The ghosts of the dead are all around him, and Champion has to find out who murdered them, fast, or he could become one of them himself.<br></p><p>Andrew Klavan is the internationally bestselling author of thirteen novels, including <i>True Crime</i>, which was made into a film by Clint Eastwood, and <i>Don&#x2019;t Say a Word</i>, made into a film starring Michael Douglas. He has been nominated for five Edgar Awards, winning twice, and is the author of the Homelanders series for Young Adults, which have been optioned by Summit Entertainment ( Twilight&#x201d;). His essays and op-eds on politics, religion, movies and literature have appeared in <i>The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, The Washington Post,</i> and <i>The Los Angeles Times</i>. He lives in Southern California.<br>Three years ago, Dan Champion, when he was an undercover vice cop for the NYPD, broke up a child-sex slavery ring. But the case cracked Champion, and now he&#x2019;s a detective in small-town, exurban New York, still wrestling with delusions about a dead child who follows him around and a beautiful woman who wasn&#x2019;t real. But, in fact, the beautiful woman was real, and she turns up almost dead in Champion&#x2019;s small town. Soon, two ghostly assassins try to kill him, and he must grapple with his instabilities while trying to track down the Fat Woman, the titular killer in the wind, and her assassins. The prolific Klavan (The Identity Man, 2010) spends too many pages on Champion&#x2019;s inner demons and many more attempting to build a sense of apocalyptic, near-cosmic menace. But when Champion finally faces the Fat Woman, we learn that the only cosmic thing about her is her banality. That said, if readers slog through the first 200 pages, they will surely stick it out to the end. --Thomas Gaughan</p><h2>Love and Loss: American Portrait and Mourning Miniatures</h2><p>Portrait miniatures, small enough to fit in the palm of the hand, are uniquely personal works of art. From colonial times to the age of photography, they were often commissioned to commemorate births, engagements, marriages, deaths, and journeys. This beautifully illustrated book reproduces one hundred miniatures, discusses their role in American art history, and relates fascinating stories of their making.Copublished with the Yale University Art Gallery</p><p>Robin Jaffee Frank is associate curator of American paintings and sculpture at the Yale University Art Gallery.This thick book's other dimensions are approximately those of a next-larger-than-regular-size postcard. Yet most of its colorplates are full-scale reproductions, for the brilliantly lifelike paintings in them are tiny portraits painted in watercolor on thin ivory disks. During the hundred years before photography, they were all the rage among Americans who could afford their highly skilled creators' fees. Before that, they had evolved from medieval manuscript illuminations and enjoyed 400 years' popularity in Britain. Such famous American artists as Benjamin West, John Singleton Copley, and the three generations of Peales produced them regularly. Frank reviews some 100 outstanding examples, reporting their genesis, generally as intimate mementos of loved ones who were frequently absent or who had died, and examining their technical qualities. Fascinating art history that makes for a near-perfect book to while away the hours with. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Rex takes it upon himself to solve the mystery, but the most intriguing evidence&#x2015;a burnt manuscript&#x2015;offers few clues. Could the killer be the sherry-swilling handyman?

A deadly purple vapor passes over the world and annihilates all living creatures except one man, Adam Jeffson. He embarks on an epic journey across a silent and devastated planet, an apocalyptic Robinson Crusoe putting together the semblance of a normal life from the flotsam and jetsam of his former existence. As he descends into madness over the years, he becomes increasingly aware that his survival was no accident and that his destiny -- and the fate of the human race -- are part of a profound, cosmological plan.M.

His paintings create vivid scenes of captain and crew-the helmsman reads a comic book and eats oreos in his bunk; the young girl in a commodore's hat munches on a hot dog in her cabin. What the book doesn't offer is a vivid translation of the poem. Gone in this version are the jingoist lines, but also some wonderful images. A gunner who "fired salutes in the captain's boots" is not quite the same as Carryl's who "fired salutes with the captain's boots." Also, LaMarche has eliminated the Binnacle-bats and ends the poem, not with the merry commandeering of a Chinese junk ("we left the crew of the junk to chew/ The bark of the rubagub tree"), but with the stock sweet image "We plotted our course for the Land of Blue Horse,/Due west 'cross the Peppermint Sea." What makes a poem appealing to young readers is not seeing themselves mirrored in illustrations, but rather the imaginative use of language. Fans of the Window Blind will do well to turn to Ted Rand's interpretation (Arcade, 1992), which also includes its music and chorus.<br><i>Kathleen Whalin, Greenwich Country Day School, CT</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Guggenheims</h2><p><p>A portrait of a great American dynasty and its legacy in business, technology, the arts, and philanthropy</p><p>Meyer Guggenheim, a Swiss immigrant, founded a great American business dynasty. At their peak in the early twentieth century, the Guggenheims were reckoned among America's wealthiest, and the richest Jewish family in the world after the Rothschilds. They belonged to Our Crowd, that tight social circle of New York Jewish plutocrats, but unlike the others -- primarily merchants and financiers -- they made their money by extracting and refining copper, silver, lead, tin, and gold.</p><p>The secret of their success, the patriarch believed, was their unity, and in the early years Meyer's seven sons, under the leadership of Daniel, worked as one to expand their growing mining and smelting empire. Family solidarity eventually decayed (along with their Jewish faith), but even more damaging was the paucity of male heirs as Meyer and the original set of brothers passed from the scene.</p><p>In the third generation, Harry Guggenheim, Daniel's son, took over leadership and made the family a force in aviation, publishing, and horse-racing. He desperately sought a successor but tragically failed and was forced to watch as the great Guggenheim business enterprise crumbled.</p><p>Meanwhile, "Guggenheim" came to mean art more than industry. In the mid-twentieth century, led by Meyer's son Solomon and Solomon's niece Peggy, the Guggenheims became the agents of modernism in the visual arts. Peggy, in America during the war years, midwifed the school of abstract expressionism, which brought art leadership to New York City. Solomon's museum has been innovative in spreading the riches of Western art around the world. After the generation of Harry and Peggy, the family has continued to produce many accomplished members, such as publisher Roger Straus II and archaeologist Iris Love.</p><p>In <em>The Guggenheims</em>, through meticulous research and absorbing prose, Irwin Unger, the winner of a Pulitzer Prize in history, and his wife, Debi Unger, convey a unique and remarkable story -- epic in its scope -- of one family's amazing rise to prominence.</p></p><p><p>Together Irwin and Debi Unger have authored <strong>LBJ: A Life</strong> and several other books. They live in New York City.</p>In 1848 -- the year that gold was discovered at Sutter's Mill near Sacramento, Calif. -- a Swiss Jewish peddler named Meyer Guggenheim arrived on a dock in Philadelphia, a major manufacturing center where he hoped to seek the fortune denied him in the repressive Swiss canton from which he had come. In 1984, almost a hundred of his descendants thronged the spiraling ramp of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum on New York City's Fifth Avenue for a group portrait, part of a celebration of one of the great American business dynasties. With a fortune based on a mining and refining empire that stretched from one end of the Western hemisphere to the other, the Guggenheims had become one of the richest families in the United States, outranked only by clans with names like Rockefeller, Ford, Mellon and Morgan; they had been U.S. senators, ambassadors and Kentucky Derby winners; they had pioneered in aviation, owned newspapers, endowed an iconic foundation to nurture intellectual life in America, and helped spread the gospel of modernism in the visual arts.<p> No wonder that in the 1960s Harry Guggenheim -- a World War I air ace, U.S. ambassador to Cuba and co-founder of Newsday -- discussed chronicling the saga of his family with one of his cousins, Harold Loeb. Loeb is now chiefly remembered as the model for Robert Cohn, the sad-sack Jewish patsy who is Jake Barnes's rival for the affections of Lady Brett Ashley in Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises; but as the founding editor of Broom, one of the iconic Little Magazines of 1920s expatriate Paris, he was also a man of some literary perspicacity. As Irwin and Debi Unger report in The Guggenheims, he was "skeptical of the enterprise. The subject was probably too big, they agreed. A biography of Meyer or of Harry's father, Daniel, might be more manageable. 'But if the writer is good enough,' Harold speculated, 'I suppose he can make a good book out of the larger canvas.' " </p><p>Unfortunately -- despite a wealth of credentials that include Irwin Unger's Pulitzer Prize for The Greenback Era -- the Ungers haven't managed to write that good book. Seemingly overwhelmed by their large and variegated cast of characters, and by the demands of telling both a public (or professional) and private story, they have produced a curiously arbitrary and bloodless account of this extraordinary family. They begin with 174 pages of corporate history -- the founding, growth and diversification of the Guggenheims' mining and metals-refining companies, among them Guggenex (Guggenheim Exploration Company), ASARCO (American Smelting and Refining Company) and Kennecott Copper -- that have all the excitement and allure of an annual report. And when they finally do turn to the flesh-and-blood Guggenheims behind these mining and smelting ventures, they race through their histories like guides in a portrait gallery.</p><p> Here's Isaac, "more an accountant than an entrepreneur," who had a fortune of $10 million, two houses in New York City and an Italian Renaissance mansion on Long Island; here's Daniel, "the family's chieftain," who "survived his older brother [Isaac] by eight years," had "a ten-room suite at the luxurious new St. Regis Hotel" and a Long Island mansion of his own, and was married to Florence, "a classically dutiful wife" whose role was to "oil the wheels" of her husband's social existence while simultaneously acting as a "sparkplug of the New York section of the Council on Jewish Women." (Did I mention that the mixed metaphor seems to be the Ungers' stylistic signature?) Over here we have Robert, "the spitting image of his father," who became a playboy and sexual adventurer, with multiple wives and mistresses; Gladys, who married Roger Straus (of the department-store and U.S. cabinet Strauses) at a wedding "attended by various Gimbels, Marshalls, Morgenthaus, Untermeyers, Adlers, Loebs, Strauses, and . . . many of the gentile high and mighty: Mrs. Theodore Roosevelt, the Nicholas Longworths, Andrew Carnegie and his wife" and others. </p><p>And let's not forget Simon's two sons, George Denver, a gay manic depressive who "squandered his money in nightclubs and on drink and drugs" before shooting himself to death in 1939, and John Simon, "a sweet-faced lad" who died of mastoiditis while a student at Phillips Exeter Academy and was memorialized by the foundation bearing his name; nor their uncle William, a tireless crusader against Roosevelt's New Deal who was also a Broadway angel, chorus-girls' sugar-daddy and composer of now-forgotten popular songs like "Crumbs of Love." Alas, before any of these briefly sketched personages can develop into a full-fledged character, the Ungers recite his or her death date or the amount of his or her estate and turn to the next item in the checklist.</p><p> Only three Guggenheims escape the capsule-history treatment -- Harry, Solomon and Peggy, arguably the most colorful members of this far from lackluster family -- and the chapters devoted to them give a hint of the kind of book The Guggenheims might have been if it were better designed and focused. Harry, the Ungers relate, was an anomaly, at once the most controlling and most adventurous of his siblings. He took flyers on chancy enterprises like racing horses, starting up newspapers, bankrolling the then-little-known Jimmy Doolittle to develop the technology for instrument flying, and funding Robert Goddard's rocket research in the 1930s. But he was also a compulsive micro-manager who not only plotted out activity schedules for relatives visiting his South Carolina shooting lodge in his absence but also monitored his family's intestinal behavior, greeting his grandsons at breakfast with, "Boys, have you done your duty today?" </p><p>Unlike Harry, Solomon allowed himself to be overwhelmed, submitting his heart and his wallet to the iron whim of the German baroness and Surrealism proselytizer Hilla Rebay, who in the 1920s persuaded him to begin amassing a collection of contemporary art that became one of the landmarks of 20th-century modernism. "Hilla gave uncle Sol a whole new existence," said his niece Gladys Straus. Rebay not only guided his acquisitions but also persuaded him to hire Frank Lloyd Wright to design a building to house the collection: a radical, even revolutionary structure that, as the New York Times's architecture critic, Ada Louise Huxtable, wrote, "has been hailed as a masterpiece, attacked as an atrocity, called the finest museum of all time and denounced as no museum at all." </p><p>The Ungers maintain that Sol's relationship with Rebay "while libidinous, . . . may well have sidestepped actual intercourse" (now there's a dance step); but there can be no doubt about the role of sex in the art-collecting habits of Sol's niece, Peggy, a love-starved woman whose childhood was blighted by the death of her father on the Titanic. "Peggy went to bed with everyone," said the assistant to Alfred Barr, founding director of the Museum of Modern Art. The list of her partners is a kind of honor roll of mid-20th-century culture: In addition to her two husbands, the High-Bohemian icon Laurence Vail and the Surrealist poet-painter Max Ernst, she had liaisons with Marcel Duchamp, Samuel Beckett, Yves Tanguy and scores of others. When she wasn't going to bed with artists, she was buying and exhibiting their work -- first in her innovative New York gallery, Art of This Century, and later at her palazzo (later the Peggy Guggenheim Collection) in Venice; and she was among the first to give one-man shows to the emerging American Abstract Expressionists, including Jackson Pollock. As the Ungers see it, "Peggy's quest for love had, as Freud supposed, been sublimated into art after all." While this kind of psychologizing may seem facile, it's a welcome change from the pallid recitation of real-estate holdings and corporate due diligence that constitutes the first part of this book.</p><p> "It would be satisfying," the Ungers write, as if to forestall such criticism, "to squeeze the Guggenheims into the family pattern described by Thomas Mann in Buddenbrooks, his novel about a nineteenth-century L�beck merchant family. . . . But real life is messier than biographers would like." That, alas, is precisely the point. Real life isn't sliced and diced into a set of segregated chapters on business and family affairs or interrupted by comments like "We shall reserve this story to a later chapter." It's organic; it ebbs and flows, dictated by events and personalities. A good biography recognizes this truth and does its best to replicate it; too bad that Irwin and Debi Unger couldn't do the same.</p><p>Reviewed by Amanda Vaill <br>Copyright 2005, The Washington Post Co.

Here Ruth Berins Collier and David Collier focus on the response of national states to the newly radicalized working class and organized labor movements that arose earlier in this century in the course of capitalist modernization. They examine the incorporation of the labor movement, showing how national leaders--including Percn in Argentina and Vargas in Brazil--sought to impose a new political and institutional framework on working-class politics. Through a comparative-historical analysis of eight countries, the authors show how different strategies of control and mobilization left distinct legacies in terms of political coalitions, party systems, and modes of political conflict. These outcomes in turn influenced patterns of regime change, including the democratic or authoritarian path each country followed through the turbulent 1960s and 1970s. The concluding chapter asks whether Latin America may now be entering a new critical juncture.</p></p><p><b>Ruth Berins Collier</b> is professor of political science at the University of California, Berkeley.<br> <b>David Collier </b>is professor of political science at the University of California, Berkeley.&#x201c;This is a monumental work, a tour de force.

Then the October Horse's head and genitalia were amputated. The genitals were rushed to bleed on the sacred hearth in the Regia, Rome's oldest temple, after which they were given to the Vestal Virgins to burn to ashes in the sacred flame of Vesta; later these ashes were mixed into cakes offered on the anniversary of the founding of Rome by her first king, Romulus. The decorated head was tossed into the midst of two teams of humble citizens, one from the Subura district, one from the Sacra Via district, who fought strenuously for possession of it. If the Subura won, the head was nailed to the Turris Mamilia. If the Sacra Via won, the head was nailed to an outer wall of the Regia. </p><p> In this ritual so old that no one remembered how it had begun, the very best that Rome owned was sacrificed to the twin powers that ruled her: war and land. Out of them came her might, her prosperity, her everlasting glory. The death of the October Horse was at once a mourning of the past and a vision of the future. </p><p> Copyright � 2002 by Colleen McCullough</p></p><h2>Superman From the 30S to the 80S</h2><p>A nostalgic tour through the world of the superhuman hero covers the entire range of his career fighting crime and corruption</p><p></p><h2>CASES IN COMPETITIVE STRATEGY</h2><p><p> What fundamentally determines the profit potential of a business? What does a company do to protect its territory from another firm seeking to enter it? How is it able to forecast its future under shifting and uncertain conditions -- or predict how its rivals will behave under those same conditions? </p><p> Most firms must face strategic questions like these when planning their future. The decisions they make must be based upon a rigorous, thorough analysis of the competition. That analysis and those decisions are the subject of this broad and comprehensive casebook, the essential companion volume to Michael Porter's widely acclaimed <i>Competitive Strategy.</i> The focus here is the actual competitive strategies of companies in 18 important industries and the portrayal of the competitive situations they face. </p><p> The 26 indepth case studies provide the student with a laboratory in which to develop a working understanding of competition and the ability to identify the factors that shape the success or failure of a firm. Each case places the reader in a real-world business setting -- giving him the strategist's view of Kodak, for example, or General Electric -- and allows for the firsthand exploration of various problems involved in designing and implementing strategy. The reader must cope with making choices actual companies have faced. </p><p> A major theme of the book is that a firm can shape the roles of competition in its favor if it understands these rules in a sophisticated way. </p><p> Michael Porter first developed his ideas on competitive strategy in a famous course at the Harvard Business School. As described in <i>Competitive Strategy,</i> Porter finds three types of tools for strategy development. The first is the "general analytic techniques," applicable to any industry or competition, which allow an indepth analysis of such competitive issues as industry evolution, competition profiling, strategy toward suppliers and buyers, entry barriers, and market signals. The second is tools for analyzing "generic structure settings," or characteristic types of industry structures such as fragmented industries, global industries, and declining industries. The third is tools for making such strategic decisions as capacity expansion, integration, entry, divestment, and coalition. </p><p> Each of the 18 industries in <i>Cases in Competitive Strategy</i> provides an opportunity for analysis using these tools. The intent of the book is cumulative, building through successively complex situations to an overview of how, when, and why various offensive and defensive strategic decisions can and should be made. </p><p> Though the cases in <i>Cases in Competitive Strategy</i> are significant and informative when studied on their own, they were designed to be read and analyzed in combination with the companion volume, <i>Competitive Strategy.</i> Used this way, both the conceptual materials and the cases themselves are mutually reinforcing, establishing in the reader's mind the connection between the theory and the practice of competitive strategy formulation. No student of business strategy can afford to be without this broad-range series of applications of the most talked-about topic in business today.</p></p><p></p><h2>The game of the foxes: British and German intelligence operations and personalities which changed the course of the Second World War</h2><p>&#34;This book is ostensibly about German espionage, but the political history includes a great deal of information that will startle many readers.

The day is typically unstable, the garden lush and shining, the branches weighty with still-falling rain.&nbsp;<br><br> There is a man and the man is me.<br><br> I am at the back door, tobacco tin in hand, and I am watching something in the trees, a figure, standing at the perimeter of the garden, where the aspens crowd in at the fence. Another man.<br> He&#x2019;s carrying a pair of binoculars and a camera.<br><br> A -bird--watcher, I am telling myself as I pull the frail paper along my tongue, you get them in these parts. But at the same time I&#x2019;m thinking, -Really? -Bird--watching, this far up the valley? I&#x2019;m also thinking, Where is my daughter, the baby, my wife? How quickly could I reach them, if I needed to?<br><br> My heart cranks into high gear, -thud--thudding against my ribs. I squint into the white sky. I am about to step out into the garden. I want the guy to know I&#x2019;ve seen him, to see me seeing him. I want him to register my size, my former -track--and--field--star physique (slackening and loosening a little, these days, admittedly). I want him to run the odds, me versus him, through his head. He&#x2019;s not to know I&#x2019;ve never been in a fight in my life and intend it to stay that way. I want him to feel what I used to feel before my father disciplined me: I am on to you, he would say, with a pointing finger, directed first at his chest, then mine.<br><br> I am on to you, I want to yell while I fumble to pocket my cigarette and lighter.<br><br> The guy is looking in the direction of the house. I see the tinder spark of sun on a lens and a movement of his arm that could be the brushing away of a hair across the forehead or the depression of a camera shutter.<br><br> Two things happen very fast. The dog&#x2014;a whiskery, leggy, slightly arthritic wolfhound, usually given to sleeping by the stove&#x2014; streaks out of the door, past my legs, and into the garden, emitting a volley of low barks, and a woman comes around the side of the house.<br><br> She has the baby on her back, she is wearing the kind of sou&#x2019;wester hood usually sported by North Sea fishermen, and she is holding a shotgun.<br><br> She is also my wife.<br><br> The latter fact I still have trouble adjusting to, not only because the idea of this creature ever agreeing to marry me is highly improbable, but also because she pulls unexpected shit like this all the time.<br><br> &#x201c;Jesus, honey,&#x201d; I gasp, and I am momentarily distracted by how shrill my voice is. &#x201c;Unmanly&#x201d; -doesn&#x2019;t cover it. I sound as if I&#x2019;m admonishing her for an -ill--judged choice in soft furnishings or for wearing pumps that clash with her purse.<br><br> She ignores my high-pitched intervention&#x2014;who can blame her?&#x2014;and fires into the air. Once, twice.<br> If, like me, you&#x2019;ve never heard a gun report at close range, let me tell you the noise is an ear shattering explosion. Magnesium-hued lights go off inside your head; your ears ring with the three-bar high note of an aria; your sinuses fill with tar.<br><br> The sound ricochets off the side of the house, off the flank of the mountain, then back again: a huge aural tennis ball bouncing about the valley. I realize that while I&#x2019;m ducking, cringing, covering my head,&nbsp;the baby is strangely unmoved. He&#x2019;s still sucking his thumb, head leaning against the spread of his mother&#x2019;s hair. Almost as if he&#x2019;s used to this. Almost as if he&#x2019;s heard it all before.<br> I straighten up. I take my hands off my ears. Far away, a figure is sprinting through the undergrowth. My wife turns around. She cracks the gun in the crook of her arm. She whistles for the dog. &#x201c;Ha,&#x201d; she says to me before she vanishes back around the side of the house. &#x201c;That&#x2019;ll show him.&#x201d;<br><br> My wife, I should tell you, is crazy. Not in a requiring-medication-and-wards-and-men-in-white-coats sense although I sometimes wonder if there may have been times in her past&#x2014;but in a subtle, more socially acceptable, less ostentatious way. She -doesn&#x2019;t think like other people. She believes that to pull a gun on someone lurking, in all likelihood entirely innocently, at our perimeter fence is not only permissible but indeed the right thing to do.<br><br>Here are the bare facts about the woman I married:<br> &#x2014;She&#x2019;s crazy, as I might have mentioned.<br> &#x2014;She&#x2019;s a recluse.<br><br> She&#x2019;s apparently willing to pull a gun on anyone threatening to uncover her hiding place.<br> I dart, insomuch as a man of my size can dart, through the house to catch her. I&#x2019;m going to have this out with her. She can&#x2019;t keep a gun in a house where there are small children. She just can&#x2019;t.<br><br> I&#x2019;m repeating this to myself as I pass through the house, planning to begin my protestations with it. But as I come through the front door, it&#x2019;s as if I&#x2019;m entering another world. Instead of the gray drizzle at the back, a dazzling, primrose-tinted sun fills the front garden, which gleams and sparks as if hewn from jewels. My daughter is leaping over a rope that her mother is -turning. My wife who, just a moment ago, was a dark, forbidding figure with a gun, a long gray coat, and a hat like Death&#x2019;s hood, she has shucked off the sou&#x2019;wester and transmogrified back to her usual incarnation. The baby is crawling on the grass, knees wet with rain, the bloom of an iris clutched in his fist, chattering to himself in a satisfied, guttural growl.<br><br>It&#x2019;s as if I&#x2019;ve stepped into another time frame entirely, as if I&#x2019;m in one of those folktales where you think you&#x2019;ve been asleep for an hour or so, but you wake to find you&#x2019;ve been away a lifetime, that all your loved ones and everything you&#x2019;ve ever known are dead and gone. Did I -really just walk in from the other side of the house, or did I fall asleep for a hundred years?<br><br> I shake off this notion. The gun business needs to be dealt with right now. &#x201c;Since when,&#x201d; I demand, &#x201c;do we own a firearm?&#x201d;<br><br> My wife raises her head and meets my eye with a challenging, flinty look, the skipping rope coming to a stop in her hand. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s mine.&#x201d;<br><br> A typical parry from her. She appears to answer the question without answering it at all. She picks on the element that isn&#x2019;t the subject of the question. The essence of sidestepping.<br><br> I rally. I&#x2019;ve had more than enough practice. &#x201c;Since when do you own a firearm?&#x201d;<br><br> She shrugs a shoulder, bare, I notice, and tanned to a soft gold, bisected by a thin white strap. I feel a momentary automatic mobilization deep inside my underwear&#x2014;strange how this doesn&#x2019;t change with age for men, that we&#x2019;re all of us but a membrane away from our inner teenage selves&#x2014;but I pull my attention back to the discussion. She&#x2019;s not going to get away with this.<br><br> &#x201c;Since now,&#x201d; she says.<br><br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s a fire arm?&#x201d; my daughter asks, splitting the word in two, her small, heart-shaped face tilted up to look at her mother.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s an Americanism,&#x201d; my wife says. &#x201c;It means &#x2018;gun.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, the gun,&#x201d; says my sweet Marithe, six years old, equal parts pixie, angel, and sylph. She turns to me. &#x201c;Father Christmas brought Donal a new one, so he said Maman could have his old one.&#x201d;<br><br> This utterance renders me, for a moment, speechless. Donal is an -ill--scented homunculus who farms the land farther down the valley. He&#x2014;and his wife, I&#x2019;d imagine&#x2014;have what you might call a problem with anger management. Somewhat trigger-happy, Donal. He shoots everything on sight: squirrels, rabbits, foxes, -hill walkers (just kidding).<br><br>&#x201c;What is going on?&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re keeping a firearm in the house and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c; &#x2018;Gun,&#x2019; Daddy. Say &#x2018;gun.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;&#x2014;a gun, without telling me? Without discussing it with me? Don&#x2019;t you see how dangerous that is? What if one of the children&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> My wife turns, her hem swishing through the wet grass. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t it nearly time to leave for your train?&#x201d;<br></p></p><h2>Purr M for Murder: A Cat Rescue Mystery</h2><p>Sydney McCall left behind an ex-fiance&#x301; and a New York advertising job to return home to Deer Park, North Carolina and help her sister, Kat, run the local animal shelter, Friendly Paws.

Carved from paper and mounted on a book, it bore a tag expressing support for the Library&#39;s work. From then until November 2011 nine more mysterious paper sculptures appeared in arts venues throughout Edinburgh, including the National Library of Scotland, the Filmhouse cinema, the National Museum of Scotland and the Scottish Storytelling Centre. Left anonymously, they appear to be the work of one highly talented and generous artist. In a farewell note, the artist identified herself as a woman and an artist/artisan, and she announced that the project had ended.</p><p>Anonymous is an artist.As symbols of love for libraries go, cutting up books wouldn't be most readers' first thought.

McDougall marshals the latest scholarship and writes in a style redolent of passion, pathos, and humor in pursuit of truths often obscured in books burdened with political slants.</p><p>From the origins of English expansion under Henry VIII to the founding of the United States to the rollicking election of President Andrew Jackson, McDougall rescues from myth or oblivion the brave, brilliant, and flawed people who made America great: women and men, native-born and immigrant; German, Latin, African, and British; as well as farmers, engineers, planters, merchants; Protestants, Freemasons, Catholics, and Jews; and -- last but not least -- the American scofflaws, speculators, rogues, and demagogues.</p><p>With an insightful approach to the nearly 250 years spanning America's beginnings, McDougall offers his readers an understanding of the uniqueness of the "American character" and how it has shaped the wide-ranging course of historical events. McDougall explains that Americans have always been in a unique position of enjoying "more opportunity to pursue their ambitions...than any other people in history." Throughout <em>Freedom Just Around the Corner</em> the character of the American people shines, a character built out of a freedom to indulge in the whole panoply of human behavior. The genius behind the success of the United States is founded on the complex, irrepressible American spirit.</p><p>A grand narrative rich with new details and insights about colonial and early national history, Freedom Just Around the Corner is the first installment of a trilogy that will eventually bring the story of America up to the present day -- story as epic, bemusing, and brooding as Bob Dylan's "Jokerman," the ballad that inspires its titles.</p></p><p><p>A professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania, Walter A. McDougall is the author of many books, including the Pulitzer Prize-winning <em>The Heavens and the Earth</em> and <em>Let the Sea Make a Noise</em>. . . . He lives in Pennsylvania with his wife and two teenage children.</p>Anyone aspiring to write a multivolume history of the U.S. reckons with illustrious predecessors, especially the histories of Daniel Boorstin and Richard Hofstadter (the latter never completed). But those histories were interpretive; they had a particular slant on the past. McDougall's is more explanatory. It provides up-to-date understanding of much that happened in our early history but without a sharply etched point of view. It's thus a bit like a textbook, struggling to keep readers' attention on all it packs in. Fortunately, in this regard it succeeds wonderfully well. Briskly written, deeply researched, fact-filled and satisfyingly wide in its coverage, it's mainly a history of the public attributes of the colonies and early nation&#x2014;the ethnic and racial groups (including Native Americans), its states, religious denominations, political parties, wars and institutions. There's little social history here or the history of ideas and culture, little about subjects like women, gays, historical myths and memory. But no single history, not even in a projected three volumes, can cover everything. McDougall's particular strength is that he keeps individuals front and center: the work is alive with humans and their struggles and achievements. Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winner McDougall (for The Heavens and the Earth: A Political History of the Space Age) says at the start that his theme will be the conditions that made for Americans' world-known "hustling" behavior and mentality. Fortunately, he quickly drops this line. There's a better and more fitting word for people's desire to better their lot: ambition. That's what this book has in full measure.

Student days at Oxford with Burne-Jones and the important influence of Ruskin and the Pre-Raphaelites come next, and then the book turns to Morris's own homes and gardens: Red House, Kelmscott Manor in Oxfordshire, Kelmscott House in Hammersmith and the Abbey Works at Merton. Morris's own words and those of his daughter May show his very personal approach to flowers and gardens and how his ideas anticipated the theories of William Robinson and Gertrude Jekyll.<br>The final chapter takes a close look at Morris's use of flowers in his designs. Did he draw the flowers he knew and loved or did he instinctively rely on the timeless wood engravings in old herbals? His lectures on the use of twining stem and curling tendril are a lesson to pattern-makers still.</p><p>This is the first title to examine Morris' gardens and flowers and their influence on his design achievements. Familiarity with Morris' works and history will lend an even greater appreciation for Baker's accomplishment and focus here; though newcomers to Morris may also discover his fine art through photos and his words. A fine focus on the artist's influences and life is achieved here, balancing art presentation with biography. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>The Big O</h2><p>Karen's easy life as a receptionist and armed robber is about to take a turn for the worse.

She has no interest in collaborating with the authors of the Gospel&#x2014;her keepers, who provide her with food and shelter and visit her regularly. She does not agree that her son is the Son of God; nor that his death was &#x201c;worth it;&#x201d; nor that the &#x201c;group of misfits he gathered around him, men who could not look a woman in the eye,&#x201d; were holy disciples. Mary judges herself ruthlessly (she did not stay at the foot of the Cross until her son died&#x2014;she fled, to save herself), and is equally harsh on her judgement of others. This woman who we know from centuries of paintings and scripture as the docile, loving, silent, long-suffering, obedient, worshipful mother of Christ becomes a tragic heroine with the relentless eloquence of Electra or Medea or Antigone. T�ib�n&#x2019;s tour de force of imagination and language is a portrait so vivid and convincing that our image of Mary will be forever transformed.</p><p>Colm T�ib�n is the author of seven novels, including <i>The Master</i>, winner of the Los Angeles Times Book Prize; <i>Brooklyn</i>, winner of the Costa Book Award; <i>The Testament of Mary</i>, and <i>Nora Webster</i>, as well as two story collections.

There is something hungry and rough in them, a brutality boiling in their blood, which I have seen before and can smell as an animal that is being hunted can smell. But I am not being hunted now. Not anymore. I am being cared for, and questioned softly, and watched. They think that I do not know the elaborate nature of their desires. But nothing escapes me now except sleep. Sleep escapes me. Maybe I am too old to sleep. Or there is nothing further to be gained from sleep. Maybe I do not need to dream, or need to rest. Maybe my eyes know that soon they will be closed for ever. I will stay awake if I have to. I will come down these stairs as the dawn breaks, as the dawn insinuates its rays of light into this room. I have my own reasons to watch and wait. Before the final rest comes this long awakening. And it is enough for me to know that it will end.<br> <br>They think I do not understand what is slowly growing in the world; they think I do not see the point of their questions and do not notice the cruel shadow of exasperation that comes hooded in their faces or hidden in their voices when I say something vague or foolish, something which leads us nowhere. When I seem not to remember what they think I must remember. They are too locked into their vast and insatiable needs and too dulled by the remnants of a terror we all felt then to have noticed that I remember everything. Memory fills my body as much as blood and bones.<br> <br>I like it that they feed me and pay for my clothes and protect me. And in return I will do for them what I can, but no more than that. Just as I cannot breathe the breath of another or help the heart of someone else to beat or their bones not to weaken or their flesh not to shrivel, I cannot say more than I can say. And I know how deeply this disturbs them and it would make me smile, this earnest need for foolish anecdotes or sharp, simple patterns in the story of what happened to us all, except that I have forgotten how to smile. I have no further need for smiling. Just as I had no further need for tears. There was a time when I thought that I had, in fact, no tears left, that I had used up my store of tears, but I am lucky that foolish thoughts like this never linger, are quickly replaced by what is true. There are always tears if you need them enough. It is the body that makes tears. I no longer need tears and that should be a relief, but I do not seek relief, merely solitude and some grim satisfaction which comes from the certainty that I will not say anything that is not true.<br> <br>Of the two men who come, one was there with us until the end. There were moments then when he was soft, ready to hold me and comfort me as he is ready now to scowl impatiently when the story I tell him does not stretch to whatever limits he has ordained. Yet I can see signs of that softness still and there are times when the glow in his eyes returns before he sighs and goes back to his work, writing out the letters one by one that make words he knows I cannot read, which recount what happened on the hill and the days before and the days that followed. I have asked him to read the words aloud to me but he will not. I know that he has written of things that neither he saw nor I saw. I know that he has also given shape to what I lived through and he witnessed, and that he has made sure that these words will matter, that they will be listened to.<br> <br>I remember too much; I am like the air on a calm day as it holds itself still, letting nothing escape. As the world holds its breath, I keep memory in.<br> <br>So when I told him about the rabbits I was not telling him something that I had half forgotten and merely remembered because of his insistent presence. The details of what I told him were with me all the years in the same way as my hands or my arms were with me. On that day, the day he wanted details of, the day he wanted me to go over and over for him, in the middle of everything that was confused, in the middle of all the terror and shrieking and the crying out, a man came close to me who had a cage with a huge angry bird trapped in it, the bird all sharp beak and indignant gaze; the wings could not stretch to their full width and this confinement seemed to make the bird frustrated and angry. It should have been flying, hunting, swooping on its prey.<br> <br>The man also carried a bag, which I gradually learned was almost half full of live rabbits, little bundles of fierce and terrorized energy. And during those hours on that hill, during the hours that went more slowly than any other hours, he plucked the rabbits one by one from the sack and edged them into the barely opened cage. The bird went for some part of their soft underbelly first, opening the rabbit up until its guts spilled out, and then of course its eyes. It is easy to talk about this now because it was a mild distraction from what was really going on, and it is easy to talk about it too because it made no sense. The bird did not seem to be hungry, although perhaps it suffered from a deep hunger that even the live flesh of writhing rabbits could not satisfy. The cage became half full of half-dead, wholly uneaten rabbits exuding strange squealing sounds. Twitching with old bursts of life. And the man&#x2019;s face was all bright with energy, there was a glow from him, as he looked at the cage and then at the scene around him, almost smiling with dark delight, the sack not yet empty.<br> <br>&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;<br> <br>By that time we had spoken of other things, including the men who played with dice close to where the crosses were; they played for his clothes and other possessions, or for no special reason. One of these men I feared as much as the strangler who arrived later. This first man was the one among all those who came and went during the day who was most alert to me, most menacing, the one who seemed most likely to want to know where I would go when it was over, the one most likely to be sent to bring me back. This man who followed me with his eyes seemed to work for the group of men with horses, who sometimes appeared to be watching from the side. If anyone knows what happened that day and why, then it is this man who played with dice. It might be easier if I said that he comes in dreams but he does not, nor does he haunt me as other things, or other faces, haunt me. He was there, that is all I have to say about him, and he watched me and he knew me, and if now, after all these years, he were to arrive at this door with his eyes narrowed against the light and his sandy-coloured hair gone grey and his hands still too big for his body, and his air of knowledge and self-possession and calm, controlling cruelty, and with the strangler grinning viciously behind him, I would not be surprised. But I would not last long in their company. Just as my two friends who visit are looking for my voice, my witness, this man who played dice, and the strangler, or others like them, must be looking for my silence. I will know them if they come and it should hardly matter now, since the days left are few, but I remain, in my waking time, desperately afraid of them.<br> <br>Compared to them, the man with the rabbits and the hawk was oddly harmless; he was cruel, but uselessly so. His urges were easy to satisfy. Nobody paid any attention to him except me, and I did because I, perhaps alone of those who were there, paid attention to every single thing that moved in case I might be able to find someone among those men with whom I could plead. And also so that I could know what they might want from us when it was over, and more than anything else so that I could distract myself, even for a single second, from the fierce catastrophe of what was happening.<br> <br>They have no interest in my fear and the fear all those around me felt, the sense that there were men waiting who had been told to round us up too when we sought to move away, that there seemed no possibility that we would not be held.<br> <br>The second one who comes has a different way of making his presence felt. There is nothing gentle about him. He is impatient, bored and in control of things. He writes too, but with greater speed than the other, frowning, nodding in approval at his own words. He is easy to irritate. I can annoy him just by moving across the room to fetch a dish. It is hard to resist the temptation sometimes to speak to him although I know that my very voice fills him with suspicion, or something close to disgust. But he, like his colleague, must listen to me, that is what he is here for. He has no choice.<br> <br>I told him before he departed that all my life when I have seen more than two men together I have seen foolishness and I have seen cruelty, but it is foolishness that I have noticed first. He was waiting for me to tell him something else and he sat opposite me, his patience slowly ebbing away, as I refused to return to the subject of his desires: the day our son was lost and how we found him and what was said. I cannot say the name, it will not come, something will break in me if I say the name. So we call him &#x201c;him,&#x201d; &#x201c;my son,&#x201d; &#x201c;our son,&#x201d; &#x201c;the one who was here,&#x201d; &#x201c;your friend,&#x201d; &#x201c;the one you are interested in.&#x201d; Maybe before I die I will say the name or manage on one of those nights to whisper it but I do not think so.<br> <br>He gathered around him, I said, a group of misfits, who were only children like himself, or men without fathers, or men who could not look a woman in the eye. Men who were seen smiling to themselves, or who had grown old when they were still young. Not one of you was normal, I said, and I watched him push his plate of half-eaten food towards me as though he were a child in a tantrum. Yes, misfits, I said. My son gathered misfits, although he himself, despite everything, was not a misfit, he could have done anything, he could have been quiet even, he had that capacity also, the one that is the rarest, he could have spent time alone with ease, he could look at a woman as though she were his equal, and he was grateful, good-mannered, intelligent. And he used all of it, I said, so he could lead a group of men who trusted him from place to place. I have no time for misfits, I said, but if you put two of you together you will get not only foolishness and the usual cruelty but you will also get a desperate need for something else. Gather together misfits, I said, pushing the plate back towards him, and you will get anything at all&#x2014;fearlessness, ambition, anything&#x2014;and before it dissolves or it grows, it will lead to what I saw and what I live with now.<br> <br>&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;<br> <br>Farina my neighbour leaves things for me. And sometimes I pay her. At first I did not answer the door when she knocked and even when I collected whatever she left for me&#x2014;fruit, or bread, or eggs, or water&#x2014;I saw no reason to speak to her as I passed her door later, or even pretend that I knew who she was. And I was careful not to touch the water she left. I walked to the well to get my own water, even if it left my arms strained and sore.<br> <br>When my visitors came they asked me who she was and I was glad to be able to tell them that I did not know, and had no interest in finding out, and did not know either why she left things for me other than that it gave her an excuse to hover in a place where she was not wanted. I must be careful, they said to me, and it was not hard to reply, to say that I knew that better than they knew it, and that if they had come to give me unnecessary advice, perhaps they should think of staying away.<br> <br>Slowly, however, as I passed her house and saw her at the door I began to look at her and I liked her. It made a difference that she was small, or smaller than I am, or weaker-looking even though she is younger. I presumed at first that she was alone and I believed that I would be able to deal with her if she became difficult or too persistent. But she is not alone. I have found that out. Her husband lies in bed and he cannot move and she must attend to him all day; he is in a darkened room. And her sons, like all the sons, have gone to the city to find better work, or more useful idleness, or some adventure or other, leaving Farina the goats to tend and terraces of olive trees to watch over and water to carry each day. I have made clear to her that her sons, if they ever should come here, cannot cross this threshold. I have made clear to her that I do not want their help for anything. I do not want them in this house. It takes me weeks to eradicate the stench of men from these rooms so that I can breathe air again that is not fouled by them.<br> <br>I began to nod my head when I saw her. Still I did not look at her, although I knew that she would notice the change. And out of it came more change. It was difficult at first because I could not understand her easily and she seemed to think that strange but it never stopped her talking. Soon, I began to follow most of her words, or enough of them, and I learned where it was she went every day and why she went there. I did not go with her because I wanted to. I went because my visitors, the men who come to oversee my final years, had outstayed their welcome and asked too many questions and I thought that if I disappeared on them, even for an hour or two, they might learn greater civility, or, even better, they might go.<br> <br>I did not think that the cursed shadow of what had happened would ever lift. It came like something in my heart that pumped darkness through me at the same rate as it pumped blood. Or it was my companion, my strange friend who woke me in the night and again in the morning and who stayed close all day. It was a heaviness in me that often became a weight which I could not carry. It eased sometimes but it never lifted.<br> <br>I went to the Temple with Farina for no reason. And as soon as we set out I was already enjoying the thought of the discussion when I came back about where I had been, and I was already working out what I would say to my visitors. We did not speak on the way and it was only when we were close that Farina said that each time she went there she asked only for three things&#x2014;that her husband be taken by the gods into death before he suffered more and that her sons be kept in good health and that they might be kind to her. Do you really want the first, I asked? Your husband to die? No, she said, I do not, but it would be for the best. And it was her face, the expression on her face, a sort of light in her eyes, a kindness as we entered the Temple, that I remember.<br> <br>And then I remember turning and seeing the statue of Artemis for the first time; in that second, as I stared at it, the statue was radiating abidance and bounty, fertility and grace, and beauty maybe, even beauty. And it inspired me for a moment; my own shadows fled to talk to the lovely shadows of the Temple. They left me for some minutes as though in light. The poison was not in my heart. I gazed at the statue of the old goddess, she who has seen more than I have and suffered more because she has lived more. I breathed hard to say that I had accepted the shadows, the weight, the grim presence that came to me that day when I saw my son tied up and bloody and when I heard him cry out and when I thought that nothing worse could happen until hours went by. I was wrong to think that nothing worse could happen, and everything I did to stop it failed, and everything I did in order not to think about it failed too, until it filled me with its sound, until the very menace of those hours entered my body, and I walked back from the Temple with that menace still pumping through my heart.<br> <br>With the money I had saved I bought from one of the silversmit...</p><h2>The Technique of Special Effects Cinematography (Communication arts books)</h2><p>First published in 1985. Routledge is an imprint of Taylor &amp; Francis, an informa company.</p><p></p><h2>The Hills of Chianti: The Story of a Tuscan Winemaking Family, in Seven Bottles</h2><p>The head of Italy&#x2019;s "first family" of winemaking reflects on the Antinoris&#x2019; six-hundred-year legacy and a life of good food and drink in the hills of Tuscany. If you know wine, you know the name Antinori. Since 1385, this noble Florentine family has produced some of Italy&#x2019;s finest wines. The Hills of Chianti tells the story of the Antinoris and the Tuscany they call home, through seven iconic bottles that define their legacy. From the Tignanello that ushered in the era of Super Tuscans to limited-edition vintages, these wines embody a way of life and will excite oenophile readers and lovers of Italy alike. In this family memoir Piero Antinori reveals the passion, tradition, and love of craft that have driven twenty-seven generations of vintners: from the first ancestor who signed up to the winemakers guild in the fourteenth century to Antinori&#x2019;s own three daughters, poised to carry this most celebrated family of artisans into the future. But The Hills of Chianti is about much more than wine. At its heart the Antinori story is about "Tuscan-ness": a connection to the land, an appreciation for good food and drink, and the quintessentially Italian love of hospitality that make this one of the world&#x2019;s most inspiring and memorable destinations.</p><p>Marchese Piero Antinori is president of Marchesi Antinori, one of the most historic and prestigious names in Tuscan viticulture. The Antinori estate today is a multilayered wine conglomerate with operations in Italy and around the world. Most recent in a long list of recognitions, he received a Lifetime Achievement Award from Wine Enthusiast magazine in 2009 for &#34;bringing Italy to the forefront of world enology in terms of innovation, quality, and recognition.&#34;&#x201c;Not every company can trace its origins back 600 years, so it&#x2019;s probably telling that, according to one list of the world&#x2019;s oldest family businesses, three of the top 10 are winemakers...<i>The Hills of Chianti</i> is as much about business as family, tracking the Antinori expansion in Italy and beyond as the company seeks to make better wines, and more of them...Antinori is refreshingly honest...&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>The New York Times<br></i><br>"Delectable...Whether Antinori is explaining the wine crisis of the 1960s or defining the Tuscan way of doing things or how his family roots infused him with a love of travel, the result is a pleasure. Oenophiles and those just curious for a bit more information will appreciate the technical notes about each of the seven bottles.&nbsp;A delightful celebration of an extraordinary Italian family&#x2019;s enduring love affair with wine." -<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br>&#x201c;There is no more evocative book to read on the ride through Tuscan wine country than<i> The Hills of Chianti.&#x201d; &#x2013;Book Trib&nbsp;</i><br><br>&#x201c;The long-term vision is what Antinori tries to explain in the book. He tells the story of how his company had to separate from a beverages industry partner, because the latter was too worried about the quarterly bottom line. Very gradually and carefully, Antinori grew his company by making great wines, and by expanding to make more of them. The story is well told in the book. If you care about wine, the story behind the creation of Tignanello or Solaia is well worth learning. And though the business now extends across the globe, that sense of family roots in Tuscany, in a certain aesthetic, in specific values that link it to its birthplace, is perhaps the best thing that the book communicates.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>New York Journal of Books</i><br><br>&#x201c;The author&#x2019;s well-founded experience in expanding the global market for Italian wines, as well as his genuine passion for his work and deep knowledge of the Italian terroir, informs this useful perspective for entrepreneurial readers.&#x201d; <i>&#x2013;Publishers Weekly</i><br><br> &#x201c;Anyone who loves Italian wines will enjoy spending some hours with this immensely intelligent and thoughtful Tuscan winemaker.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>Los Angeles Times<br></i><br> &#x201c;Late in the evening, Sangiovese teasing your palate, do you ever wonder how grape farming and winemaking emerged from a lineage of humble agriculture to become the modern, ultraprestigious craft of fine wine, an industry aligned with the likes of Louis Vuitton, Herm�s, and Maserati? Here is the story of Tuscany's noble Antinori family, winemakers since 1385, written by the most innovative Antinori of all. This is also the story of Tignanello, Solaia, Villa Antinori, Cervaro Della Sala, and three other iconic wines that helped the family bottle up their legacy.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>Foreword Magazine</i><br><br> 'The nettlesome question about wine is: Does it make for good reading? For a subject reflexively associated with art and romance and la dolce vita, it tends to inspire god-awful prose: mawkish evocations of landscape, endless anthropomorphizing of the product itself (noble, hedonistic, mysterious, muscular, vivacious)...A reader of Mr. Antinori's memoir, <i>The Hills of Chianti</i>...consider that Mr. Antinori happens to be working with exceptional material. More than anyone else, it was the 76-year-old godfather of Chianti Classico who first convinced the mass market that Italian wine did not have to taste like the dreck that came out of jugs and straw-covered bottles.

Taking the 1917 Balfour Declaration, the British government&#x2019;s fateful promise to favor the establishment of &#x201c;a national home for the Jewish people&#x201d; in Palestine, as its first major milestone, the story proceeds through the Arab Rebellion of the late 1930s, the Nazi Holocaust, Israel&#x2019;s independence and the Palestinian Nakba (catastrophe), the watershed of 1967 followed by the Palestinian re-awakening, Israel&#x2019;s settlement project, two Intifadas, the Oslo Accords, and continued negotiations and violence up to today. Combining engaging narrative with political analysis and social and cultural insights, <i>Enemies and Neighbors</i> is both an accessible overview and a fascinating investigation into the deeper truths of a furiously contested history that has preserved Palestinians and Israelis as unequal enemies and neighbors.</p></p><p><b>Ian Black</b> is visiting senior fellow at the Middle East Centre at the London School of Economics. He has been the Middle East editor, diplomatic editor, and European editor for the <i>Guardian</i>. He has also written for the <i>Economist</i> and the <i>Washington Post</i> and is a regular commentator on TV and radio on Middle Eastern and international affairs. He has an MA in history and political science from the University of Cambridge and a PhD in government from LSE. He lives in London.The 67 typewritten words of the Balfour Declaration combined considerations of imperial planning, wartime propaganda, biblical resonances, a colonial mindset&#x2015;as well as evident sympathy for the Zionist idea. With them, as Arthur Koestler was to quip memorably&#x2015;neatly encapsulating the attendant and continuing controversy&#x2015;&#x201c;one nation solemnly promised to a second nation the country of a third.&#x201d; Lloyd George highlighted sympathy for the Jews as his principal motivation. But the decisive calculations were political, primarily the wish to outsmart the French in post-war arrangements in the Levant and the impulse to use Palestine's strategic location&#x2015;its &#x201c;fatal geography&#x201d;&#x2015;to protect Egypt, the Suez Canal and the route to India. Other judgements have placed greater emphasis on the need to mobilise Jewish public opinion behind the then flagging Allied war effort. As Balfour told the war cabinet at its decisive meeting on October 31: &#x201c;If we could make a declaration favourable to such an ideal [Zionism], we should be able to carry on extremely useful propaganda both in Russia and in America.&#x201d; Historians have spent decades debating the connections and contradictions between Balfour's public pledge to the Zionists, the secret 1916 Sykes-Picot agreement between Britain, France and Russia about post-war spheres of influence in the Middle East, and pledges about Arab independence made by the British in 1915 to encourage Sharif Hussein of Mecca to launch his &#x201c;revolt in the desert&#x201d; against the Turks.<p><br>The truth, buried in imprecise definitions, misunderstandings and duplicity, remains elusive. The consequences of the declaration are still being played out.</p></p><h2>Those Across the River</h2><p><b>A man must confront a terrifying evil in this captivating horror novel that's "as much F.

Born in London in 1908 and educated at Eton and Sandhurst, he became the Reuters Moscow correspondent in 1929. In the spring of 1939, Fleming went back to Moscow as a special correspondent for the <b>London Times</b>. In June of that same year, he joined Naval Intelligence and served throughout World War II, finally earning the rank of Commander, RNVSR (Sp.). Much of the James Bond material was drawn directly from Fleming's experiences as an intelligence officer. Later, Fleming became a consultant on foreign affairs for the <b>London Sunday Times</b>, by which time he had become far better known as the creator of James Bond.</p><p>With its two fighting claws held forward like a wrestler's arms the big pandinus scorpion emerged with a dry rustle from the finger-sized hole under the rock.</p> <p>There was a small patch of hard, flat earth outside the hole and the scorpion stood in the centre of this on the tips of its four pairs of legs, its nerves and muscles braced for a quick retreat and its senses questing for the minute vibrations which would decide its next move.</p> <p>The moonlight, glittering down through the great thorn bush, threw sapphire highlights off the hard, black polish of the six-inch body and glinted palely on the moist white sting which protruded from the last segment of the tail, now curved over parallel with the scorpion's flat back. Slowly the sting slid home into its sheath and the nerves in the poison sac at its base relaxed. The scorpion had decided. Greed had won over fear.</p> <p>Twelve inches away, at the bottom of a sharp slope of sand, the small beetle was concerned only with trudging on towards better pastures than he had found under the thorn bush, and the swift rush of the scorpion down the slope gave him no time to open his wings. The beetle's legs waved in protest as the sharp claw snapped round his body, and then the sting lanced into him from over the scorpion's head and immediately he was dead.</p> <p>After it had killed the beetle the scorpion stood motionless for nearly five minutes. During this time it identified the nature of its prey and again tested the ground and the air for hostile vibrations. Reassured, its fighting claw withdrew from the half-severed beetle and its two small feeding pincers reached out and into the beetle's flesh. Then for an hour, and with extreme fastidiousness, the scorpion ate its victim.</p> <p>The great thorn bush under which the scorpion killed the beetle was quite a landmark in the wide expanse of rolling veld some forty miles south of Kissidougou in the south-western corner of French Guinea. On all horizons there were hills and jungle, but here, over twenty square miles, there was flat rocky ground which was almost desert and amongst the tropical scrub only this one thorn bush, perhaps because there was water deep beneath its roots, had grown to the height of a house and could be picked out from many miles away.</p> <p>The bush grew more or less at the junction of three African states. It was in French Guinea but only about ten miles north of the northernmost tip of Liberia and five miles east of the frontier of Sierra Leone. Across this frontier are the great diamond mines around Sefadu. These are the property of Sierra International, which is part of the powerful mining empire of Afric International, which in turn is a rich capital asset of the British Commonwealth.</p> <p>An hour earlier in its hole among the roots of the great thorn bush the scorpion had been alerted by two sets of vibrations. First there had been the tiny scraping of the beetle's movements, and these belonged to the vibrations which the scorpion immediately recognised and diagnosed. Then there had been a series of incomprehensible thuds round the bush followed by a final heavy quake which had caved in part of the scorpion's hole. These were followed by a soft rhythmic trembling of the ground which was so regular that it soon became a background vibration of no urgency. After a pause the tiny scraping of the beetle had continued, and it was greed for the beetle that, after a day of sheltering from its deadliest enemy, the sun, finally got the upper hand against the scorpion's memory of the other noises and impelled it out of its lair into the filtering moonlight.</p> <p>And now, as it slowly sucked the morsels of beetle-flesh off its feeding pincers, the signal for the scorpion's own death sounded from far away on the eastern horizon, audible to a human, but made up of vibrations which were far outside the range of the scorpion's sensory system.</p> <p>And, a few feet away, a heavy, blunt hand, with bitten finger nails, softly raised a jagged piece of rock. There was no noise, but the scorpion felt a tiny movement in the air above it. At once its fighting claws were up and groping and its sting was erect in the rigid tail, its near-sighted eyes staring up for a sight of the enemy.</p> <p>The heavy stone came down.</p> <p>'Black bastard.'</p> <p>The man watched as the broken insect whipped in its death agony.</p> <p>The man yawned. He got to his knees in the sandy depression against the trunk of the bush where he had been sitting for nearly two hours and, his arms bent protectingly over his head, scrambled out into the open.</p> <p>The noise of the engine which the man had been waiting for, and which had signed the scorpion's death warrant, was louder. As the man stood and stared up the path of the moon, he could just see a clumsy black shape coming fast towards him out of the east and for a moment the moonlight glinted on whirling rotor blades.</p> <p>The man rubbed his hands down the sides of his dirty khaki shorts and moved quickly round the bush to where the rear wheel of a battered motor-cycle protruded from its hiding place. Below the pillion, on either side, there were leather toolboxes. From one of these he extracted a small heavy package which he stowed inside his open shirt against the skin. From the other he took four cheap electric torches and went off with them to where, fifty yards from the big horns bush, there was a clear patch of flat ground about the size of a tennis court. At three corners of the landing ground he screwed the butt end of a torch into the ground and switched it on. Then, the last torch alight in his hand, he took up his position at the fourth corner and waited.</p> <p>The helicopter was moving slowly towards him, not more than a hundred feet from the ground, the big rotor blades idling. It looked like a huge, badly constructed insect. To the man on the ground it seemed, as usual, to be making too much noise.</p> <p>The helicopter paused, pitching slightly, directly over his head. An arm came out of the cockpit and a torch flashed at him. It flashed dot-dash, the morse for A.</p> <p>The man on the ground flashed back a B and a C. He stuck the fourth torch into the ground and moved away, shielding his eyes against the coming whirl of dust. Above him the pitch of the rotor blades flattened imperceptibly and the helicopter settled smoothly into the space between the four torches. The clatter of the engine stopped with a final cough, the tail rotor spun briefly in neutral, and the main rotor blades completed a few awkward revolutions and then drooped to a halt.</p> <p>In the echoing silence, a cricket started to zing in the thorn bush, and somewhere near at hand there was the anxious chirrup of a nightbird.</p> <p>After a pause to let the dust settle, the pilot banged open the door of the cockpit, pushed out a small aluminium ladder and climbed stiffly to the ground. He waited beside his machine while the other man walked round the four corners of the landing ground picking up and dowsing the torches. The pilot was half an hour late at the rendezvous and he was bored at the prospect of listening to the other man's inevitable complaint. He despised all Afrikaners. This one in particular. To a Reichsdeutscher and to a Luftwaffe pilot who had fought under Galland in defence of the Reich they were a bastard race, sly, stupid and ill-bred. Of course this brute had a tricky job, but it was nothing to navigating a helicopter five hundred miles over the jungle in the middle of the night, and then taking it back again.</p> <p>As the other man came up, the pilot half raised his hand in greeting. 'Everything all right?'</p> <p>'I hope so. But you're late again. I shall only just make it through the frontier by first light.'</p> <p>'Magneto trouble. We all have our worries. Thank God there are only thirteen full moons a year. Well, if you've got the stuff let's have it and we'll tank her up and I'll be off.'</p> <p>Without speaking, the man from the diamond mines reached into his shirt and handed over the neat, heavy packet.</p> <p>The pilot took it. It was damp with the sweat from the smuggler's ribs. The pilot dropped it into a side pocket of his trim bush shirt. He put his hand behind him and wiped his fingers on the seat of his shorts.</p> <p>'Good,' he said. He turned towards his machine.</p> <p>'Just a moment,' said the diamond smuggler. There was a sullen note in his voice.</p> <p>The pilot turned back and faced him. He thought: it's the voice of a servant who has screwed himself up to complain about his food. 'Ja. What is it?'</p> <p>'Things are getting too hot. At the mines. I don't like it at all. There's been a big intelligence man down from London. You've read about him. This man Sillitoe. They say he's been hired by the Diamond Corporation. There've been a lot of new regulations and all punishments have been doubled. It's frightened out some of my smaller men. I had to be ruthless and, well, one of them somehow fell into the crusher. That tightened things up a bit. But I've had to pay more. An extra ten per cent. And they're still not satisfied. One of these days those security people are going to get one of my middlemen. And you know these black swine. They can't stand a real beating.' He looked swiftly into the pilot's eyes and then away again. 'For the matter of that I doubt if anyone could stand the sjambok. Not even me.'</p> <p>'So?' said the pilot. He paused. 'Do you want me to pass this threat back to ABC?'</p> <p>'I'm not threatening anyone,' said the other man hastily.' I just want them to know that it's getting tough. They must know it themselves. They must know about this man Sillitoe. And look what the Chairman said in our annual report. He said that our mines were losing more than two million pounds a year through smug-gling and IDE and that it was up to the government to stop it. And what does that mean? It means "stop me"!'</p> <p>'And me,' said the pilot mildly. 'So what do you want? More money?'</p> <p>'Yes,' said the other man stubbornly. 'I want a bigger cut. Twenty per cent more or I'll have to quit.' He t...</p></p><h2>In the Empire of Ice: Encounters in a Changing Landscape</h2><p>In this gripping circumnavigation of the Arctic Circle, Gretel Ehrlich paints a vivid portrait of the indigenous cultures that inhabit the starkly beautiful boreal landscape surrounding the Arctic Ocean, an ice-bound wilderness that includes northern Siberia, northwestern Greenland, Canada&#x2019;s vast Nunavut, and northern Alaska. Ehrlich&#x2019;s expedition, supported by the National Geographic Society, documents what remains of these cultures, specifically the similarities and differences among them, including hunting traditions, shamanic and ceremonial practices, languages and legends the ways in which they have survived, or have been assimilated, and how they are adapting to the impact of climate change on their ice-age cultures.<br><br>Ehrlich is fascinated by what she calls the ecology of culture the ways in which the human presence of indigenous Arctic people is intricately interwoven with land, rock, river, sea, and ice. Depicting human-caused climate change as only the latest and most destructive of the ills and abuses first peoples have been suffering for 250 years, Ehrlich&#x2019;s haunting and lovely prose portrays ancient tribes and traditions on the edge of extinction and captures the austere beauty of their various lifeways in the frozen dreamscape of the world they have always known.</p><p>Gretel Ehrlich is well known for her prize-winning essays, fiction, and poetry. Her acclaimed 2002 book <i>This Cold Heaven: Seven Seasons in Greenland</i> chronicled the first years of a lasting fascination with the high latitudes. Her work has also appeared in many anthologies including: <i>Best Essays of the Century, Best American Essays,</i> and <i>Best Travel Writing.</i>&#x201c;In her third and most wrenching ice chronicle...Ehrlich reports on her recent National Geographic Expeditions circumpolar journey within a mosaic containing shards of the grim history of the conquest of the Arctic, empathic portraits of indigenous people, scientific findings, and personal reflections...Ehrlich makes it crystal clear why the demise of Arctic culture will affect us all in this deeply knowledgeable and beautifully composed elegy to a &#x201c;ruined paradise.&#x201d;<br> <i>&#x2013;Booklist Starred Review</i></p><h2>The Truth About Psychics: What&#39;s Real, What&#39;s Not, and How to Tell the Difference</h2><p><b></b><p><b> How do psychic abilities work...and how can you tell if they're real? </b> </p><p> In this fascinating look into the history of spiritualism, celebrity psychic Sylvia Browne tells all: what's real, what's not, and how to tell the difference!

Browne began her professional career in 1973 with a small meeting in her home. Within a year Browne&#x2019;s practice had grown so much that she incorporated the business as the Nirvana Foundation for Psychic Research.<p>Browne is a true professional: she maintains required business licenses, is a member of a national consumer protection agency, and donates a large portion of her time to charitable organizations and also works with police to investigate missing persons and other criminal cases. She has consulted with police and FBI on several high-profile cases, including the disappearance of Chandra Levy and the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Currently the president of her business, now known as the Sylvia Browne Corporation, Browne also founded her own church, the Society of Novus Spirit. Her most recent business venture is The Sylvia Browne Hypnosis Training Center, where her unique, proven hypnosis methods for personal and professional use are taught.</p><p>With&nbsp;twenty-two <i>New York Times </i>bestsellers, Browne is an accomplished author of more than 46 books. She appeared regularly on the <i>Montel Williams Show </i>for&nbsp;seventeen years, and has been a&nbsp;frequent&nbsp;guest on&nbsp;<i>Larry King Live</i>,&nbsp;travels the country at&nbsp;sold-out lectures,&nbsp;and regularly appears in the print media. Browne continues to do readings, and her son, Chris DuFresne, is also a psychic. She lives and practices in California.<br><br>Lindsay Harrison grew up in Massachusetts, and attended Brown University and Columbia School of the Arts.

I never had to wonder whether the spirit world existed. I knew it did. I saw it, I heard it, and I sensed it all around me, whether I wanted to or not. Without my brilliantly psychic and deeply spiritual grandmother Ada Coil there to explain what was happening and build a bridge between my unique reality and the sanctity of where it came from, I&#x2019;m sure I would have lost my sanity. (There are those who would argue that the debate about my sanity rages on, but I stopped listening to <i>them</i> decades ago.) Grandma Ada educated me about the gifts I was born with and helped me appreciate them instead of fearing them. She also taught me never to stop questioning, learning, studying, and exploring every aspect of spirituality that keeps our genetic connection to God thriving and relevant. She inspired the spiritual journey to which I&#x2019;ve devoted my life and gave me her clear footsteps to follow as I started, just as this book is my way of giving you mine. </p><p>As some of you already know, I&#x2019;m a third-generation psychic. Among my particular gifts from birth were clairvoyance (the ability to see beings that originate in other dimensions) and clairaudience (the ability to hear voices and sounds that originate in other dimensions). For added flair, I was even born with a caul, or fetal membrane, around my head, which according to ancient legend is the sign of a psychic child. So when the spirit world came to me long before I would ever have thought of seeking it out, I didn&#x2019;t understand it at first, but there was certainly no mistaking it. </p><p>I was five years old when I had my first psychic vision. We were at a family dinner when I looked over to see the faces of both my great-grandmothers melting like lava running slowly down their necks, leaving nothing but their skulls behind. The only thing that shocked me even more than this horrifying sight was the fact that no one else seemed to be seeing it but me&#x2014;either that or they were awfully nonchalant about it. Less than two weeks later, both great-grandmothers died. And with the logic of a child, I was sure that somehow, because I was the only one who&#x2019;d seen those melting faces, I was responsible for killing them. It was Grandma Ada who explained that I&#x2019;d done nothing wrong, I&#x2019;d just been given a visual form of psychic information about their impending deaths. </p><p>At around that same time I discovered (or, in my opinion, was inflicted with) the random, involuntary ability to view the insides of people who had serious medical conditions, as if I were looking at an X-ray. A neighbor or family friend or door-to-door salesman would stop by and all I would see was a blocked colon or a diseased gallbladder floating around the room. </p><p>I turned to Grandma Ada again, asking how I could go about getting rid of this supposed &#x201c;gift&#x201d; so that I wouldn&#x2019;t have to spend the rest of my life surrounded by melting faces and ravaged organs. She patiently pointed out that God gave me this gift, and gave it to me for a reason, so refusing it wasn&#x2019;t an option. I could, though, ask Him in my prayers not to show me anything I wasn&#x2019;t old enough or emotionally equipped to handle. I did that, and my prayers were answered. The visions didn&#x2019;t go away, but they were never again as graphic and terrifying. </p><p>In fact, on a couple of occasions I was grateful for them when they helped to make Grandma Ada very happy. One night she was terribly upset after unsuccessfully searching the house for a steel strongbox filled with important papers she needed. (Like all psychics, she was psychic about everyone but herself. If you lose your keys, I&#x2019;ll tell you exactly where they are. If I lose mine, I&#x2019;m as stumped as you are.) We were in her bedroom when she explained what the problem was, and at that moment a petite white-haired woman materialized, whom I recognized to be Grandma Ada&#x2019;s mother, and pointed to the back of a massive bureau. I reported this to Grandma Ada, frankly proud to be seeing a spirit she didn&#x2019;t see for a change, and it jarred her memory of slipping the strongbox behind that bureau months earlier where no one (including her, obviously) would think to look for it. </p><p>On another evening we were all gathered in the living room when I saw a man&#x2019;s form take shape behind Grandma Ada&#x2019;s left shoulder. I was sitting on the floor beside her and whispered, &#x201c;Grandma, who is that man behind you?&#x201d; </p><p>My parents had long since learned to ignore this kind of thing, so they just glanced over, saw nothing, rolled their eyes, and went back to their reading while Grandma Ada asked, &#x201c;What does he look like?&#x201d; </p><p>I described him&#x2014;tall, reddish hair, round wire-rimmed glasses. Then I added, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a string around his neck, and it has a horn on it that he uses to listen to people&#x2019;s chests.&#x201d; </p><p>I&#x2019;d never seen quite so much joy on her face as she instantly recognized it as her Uncle Jim, a doctor who&#x2019;d died in a flu epidemic twenty-four years earlier. She was thrilled that he was there with her, and I was thrilled that I&#x2019;d facilitated a reunion that made someone I adored so happy. And between those two spirit encounters with loved ones she missed so much, I started thinking maybe this psychic thing wasn&#x2019;t so bad after all. </p><p>I began seeing spirits as clearly as I saw everyone else. They especially filled my bedroom at night, which frightened me, so Grandma Ada gave me a flashlight. (To this day I can&#x2019;t sleep in a completely dark room. I&#x2019;m not frightened anymore&#x2014;it&#x2019;s just annoying, like trying to lie down and relax in the middle of a convention.) I also began &#x201c;knowing things&#x201d; without having a clue how or why I knew them. </p><p>I announced my grandfather&#x2019;s death to my family several minutes before my father rushed in to break the news. </p><p>I answered the door before anyone knocked and knew who was going to be standing there before I opened it. </p><p>One afternoon I pulled my father out of a movie theater in a panic screaming, &#x201c;Sharon can&#x2019;t breathe!&#x201d; We arrived home to discover that my little sister had collapsed with double pneumonia, and the doctors said later that Daddy had reached the emergency room with Sharon with only moments to spare. </p><p>A little classmate of mine came to show me the crepe paper witch costume she planned to wear for Halloween trick-or-treating that night. The instant she stepped in the door, I &#x201c;saw&#x201d; her costume bursting into flames. Within minutes, while she was prancing around the room perfecting her menacing witch moves, she whirled too close to the wall heating grate and, identical to my vision, her costume ignited. I&#x2019;m convinced that &#x201c;seeing&#x201d; this before it actually happened allowed me to help rather than panic, as I immediately threw her to the ground and rolled her up in an area rug before she even had time to scream. She left the house, completely unharmed, to go find a replacement for her ruined costume. </p><p>I &#x201c;saw&#x201d; my friend Joan violently slamming her head against the dashboard of a blue car, and it was such a clear, horrible vision that I told her about it and begged her not to get in any blue cars for a while. Within weeks she found herself climbing into the passenger seat of a blue car to run errands with a family friend, then remembered my warning and stayed home instead. A few hours later the brakes failed and the blue car was wrapped around a telephone pole. The family friend and the driver&#x2019;s side suffered minor damage, but the passenger seat where Joan would have been sitting was destroyed. </p><p>Of course, I was a child, with what I prefer to look back on as &#x201c;guileless candor,&#x201d; so not all of my psychic efforts were humanitarian. I remember showing off by telling my mother where my daddy really was when she thought he was at work, for example, and describing with uncanny accuracy the lovely blond woman he was visiting. (If you&#x2019;d known my mother, you wouldn&#x2019;t have blamed my daddy any more than I did. As I&#x2019;ve often said, my theory about why he never left her is that he didn&#x2019;t want to have to kiss her goodbye.) </p><p>And then one night when I was eight years old, my life changed, and it would never be the same again. </p><p>I was in my bedroom, under strict orders to go to sleep, so I was wide awake, playing with my flashlight, shining it idly around the room. Suddenly, with no warning, the light began to grow and intensify until all I could see was a white-gold glow. And from its core I heard a woman&#x2019;s voice, clear and distinct despite a rapid, unearthly, high-speed chirpiness. &#x201c;I come from God, Sylvia,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be afraid.&#x201d; </p><p>Looking back, I guess I could have found reassurance in the &#x201c;I come from God&#x201d; part, or been fascinated that after eight years of being clairvoyant, I could now officially add clairaudience to my list of psychic skills. Instead, I flew out of my bedroom in sheer terror and ran to find Grandma Ada, who was cleaning vegetables in the kitchen. She stroked my hair to comfort me, calmly explained that it was &#x201c;just&#x201d; my Spirit Guide, and went back to her carrot peeling. </p><p>My Spirit Guide has been a daily presence and a vital part of my life since that night in 1946. She spent her one lifetime on earth as an Aztec Incan and was killed by a spear in 1520 during the Spanish invasion of Colombia. Her real name is Iena, which I apparently didn&#x2019;t care for, since I&#x2019;ve never called her anything but Francine. </p><p>For those of you who don&#x2019;t unde...</p></p><h2>Elvenblood: An Epic High Fantasy (The Halfblood Chronicles)</h2><p>In the sequel to the best-selling fantasy, The Elvenbane, chaos sweeps through the magical realm after an upstart halfblood known as the Elvenbane challenges the cruel Elvenlords&#39; rule. 50,000 first printing. $50,000 ad/promo.</p><p>For well over a half century, Andre Norton was one of the most popular science fiction and fantasy authors in the world. Since her first SF novels were published in the 1940s, her tales of action and adventure throughout the galaxy have drawn countless readers to science fiction. Her fantasy, including the best-selling Witch World series, has been popular with readers for decades. Andre Norton was the first woman to receive the Gandalf Grand Master of Fantasy Award, presented by the World Science Fiction Society in 1977 and the first woman to be named a Grand Master by the Science Fiction Writers of America in 1983.The prolific Norton again collaborates with Lackey to create another thinly disguised romance/miscegenation parable serving as a fantasy/adventure novel. Sheyrene and her brother, Lorryn, are kept virtual prisoners to their father's wishes, since he is a high elven lord and has powerful elven magic that can be used to remold not only their bodies but also their minds, wills and souls. When circumstances allow them to escape, they are propelled into the paths of Shauna (who was featured in The Elvenbane, the first book of the series), a half-breed leader who has control over human and elven magic, and of her friends, wizards and shape-changing dragons who want equality for all. Inevitably, romance blossoms, war threatens and heroism ensues. Though the final battle here is rushed and depressingly anticlimactic, both authors have a sweet way with characters and there is enough magic, mystery and romantic bonding of fantastic species in genetically improbable ways to keep loyal fans entertained?and anyone with an ounce of cynicism far, far away. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Endless Universe: Beyond the Big Bang</h2><p><p>Two world-renowned scientists present an audacious new vision of the cosmos that &#x201c;steals the thunder from the Big Bang theory.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Wall Street Journal<br></i><br>The Big Bang theory&#x2014;widely regarded as the leading explanation for the origin of the universe&#x2014;posits that space and time sprang into being about 14 billion years ago in a hot, expanding fireball of nearly infinite density. Over the last three decades the theory has been repeatedly revised to address such issues as how galaxies and stars first formed and why the expansion of the universe is speeding up today. Furthermore, an explanation has yet to be found for what caused the Big Bang in the first place.<br><br>In <i>Endless Universe</i>, Paul J. Steinhardt and Neil Turok, both distinguished theoretical physicists, present a bold new cosmology. Steinhardt and Turok &#x201c;contend that what we think of as the moment of creation was simply part of an infinite cycle of titanic collisions between our universe and a parallel world&#x201d; (<i>Discover</i>). They recount the remarkable developments in astronomy, particle physics, and superstring theory that form the basis for their groundbreaking &#x201c;Cyclic Universe&#x201d; theory. According to this theory, the Big Bang was not the beginning of time but the bridge to a past filled with endlessly repeating cycles of evolution, each accompanied by the creation of new matter and the formation of new galaxies, stars, and planets.<br><br><i>Endless Universe</i> provides answers to longstanding problems with the Big Bang model, while offering a provocative new view of both the past and the future of the cosmos.&nbsp; It is a &#x201c;theory that could solve the cosmic mystery&#x201d; (<i>USA Today</i>).</p></p><p><p>PAUL J.

Beyond the realms of sea and land and air and space lay the realms of fire, which he alone had been privileged to glimpse. It was much too much to expect that he would also understand.<br>&#x2014;Arthur C. Clarke, <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i><br>Two boys sit in darkened cinemas, one in London and one in Miami, set to watch Stanley Kubrick's movie <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i>. It is 1968, a year of worldwide conflict and turmoil: Vietnam, the arms race, political assassinations, student protests, and rebellions. But all this is forgotten as the film sweeps the boys along in a glorious tale of science, space, and the future.<br><br>The boy in Miami witnessed firsthand the awesome power of technology to annihilate or inspire. Six years earlier, from his home near Homestead Air Force Base, he watched missiles being prepared for a strike on Cuba, knowing that his family and community would be obliterated if the looming crisis led to a nuclear exchange. Then, as the crisis subsided, he became galvanized by John F. Kennedy&#x2019;s promise to send a man to the Moon by the end of the decade. He emerged from these early experiences optimistic about the power of technology to improve the future and fascinated by all things scientific. He kept logbooks of every manned mission and traveled often to Cape Canaveral to observe the launches. He turned the family garage into a laboratory with large stocks of chemicals and biological specimens. And he headed to the Everglades at night, avoiding the city lights and fending off mosquitoes, to take a peek at the heavens through his telescope.<br><br>The boy in London was a refugee from South Africa, where his parents had been imprisoned for resisting the oppressive apartheid regime. But he too was optimistic, having seen the determination of people like Nelson Mandela to build a better future. Upon his parents&#x2019; release, the family had left South Africa for Kenya and then Tanzania, new countries full of natural wonders&#x2014;the Serengeti&#x2019;s wild animals and the Olduvai Gorge, home of the earliest humans. Under the hot African sun the boy had learned mathematics and science from spirited young teachers. He&#x2019;d built electric motors, made explosions, and watched ant lions for hours. In 1968 his family had moved to England for the sake of the children's education, arriving in time to watch the <i>Apollo</i> moon landings on TV.<br><br>As young children, both boys had acquired their passion for science from their fathers. Each night, the father in America told stories to his little boy of Marie Curie, Louis Pasteur, and other great discoverers. The father in Africa patiently explained the Pythagorean theorem and spoke of the great achievements of ancient Greek science. Their words were like water on seeds, feeding insatiable curiosities. How does the world work? How did it start out? Where is it headed? The boys asked the same questions that have gripped people from every society, every culture, every religion, and every continent since civilization began.<br><br>Kubrick&#x2019;s film speaks of a time in the foreseeable future when people will devote their skills and resources to uncovering the secrets of the universe. A space mission is dispatched to investigate a powerful signal emanating from one of Jupiter&#x2019;s moons. Technology, in the form of the computer HAL, threatens to end the mission, but human ingenuity and adaptability win out. A lone surviving astronaut arrives to find a giant monolith, appearing like a solid rock two thousand feet high. As he approaches, he realizes that it&#x2019;s actually the opening of an infinite shaft, drawing him into a transdimensional trip through hyperspace and revealing the creation and the future of the universe. Watching the film, neither boy realizes how prophetic this story might be.<br><b>A Real Space Odyssey</b><br><br>Fast&#x2013;forward to the real 2001: rather than a lone astronaut, a worldwide community of cosmologists engaged in an intense effort to understand the beginning of the universe. The two of us, now grown, are thrilled to be among them. The boy in Miami, Paul Steinhardt, is now a professor of mathematical physics at Princeton University. The boy in London, Neil Turok, is a professor of physics at Cambridge University in England. Each of us, following his own path, has pursued his dream of becoming an explorer of the universe, albeit with paper and pencil instead of a rocketship. Three years have passed since the two of us joined forces on a risky venture to investigate a new, transdimensional view of space and time that challenges the conventional history of the universe. <br><br>Cosmologists celebrate 2001 as the year the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) launched a satellite mission from Cape Canaveral to investigate not the black monolith of Kubrick&#x2019;s film but a thin, dark layer of space at the outermost edge of the visible universe. The mission is called WMAP (pronounced &#x201c;W-map,&#x201d;), which stands for Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe. On board is a bank of highly sensitive detectors designed to gather some of the ancient light emitted from the dark layer nearly 14 billion years ago, at a time when the first atoms were just beginning to form. Every 2.2 minutes, the satellite spins once around its axis, and every hour the axis itself traces out a circle. From the combination of motions, light from a narrow ring on the sky is collected. Over the course of six months, the entire satellite keeps shifting, until the detectors have covered the entire sky. The sequence will be repeated every six months until enough light has been gathered to make a detailed portrait of the infant universe. (WMAP is a follow&#x2013;up to the pioneering NASA satellite launched in 1989 called COBE, the Cosmic Background Explorer, which had made an initial low&#x2013;resolution image of the early universe; in 2006, the leaders of the COBE team, John Mather at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and George Smoot at the University of California at Berkeley, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics.)<br><br>Nineteen months after the WMAP launch, in February 2003, mission head Charles Bennett and his team had collected and analyzed sufficient light to announce their initial findings at NASA&#x2019;s Washington headquarters, in a press conference broadcast throughout the world. One of us watched in an auditorium at Princeton University, overflowing with what seemed like everyone in town, from mailroom clerks to middle&#x2013;school students, drawn by rumors of a great new discovery. The other was in a similarly packed lecture room in Cambridge, England. The sense of anticipation was tremendous, each crowd aware that its understanding of the origin and evolution of the universe would hinge on what the WMAP team had found.<br><br>At last, Bennett and his team unveiled the image that had emerged after a yearlong exposure. Just like the fictional astronaut peering into the monolith, the WMAP satellite had gazed into the primordial layer and obtained the first clear view of the infant universe. What the greatest thinkers in history&#x2014;from Plato to Newton to Einstein&#x2014;could only speculate about was suddenly there for all to see, bringing humanity closer to answering the ultimate question: <i>Where did it all come from?</i><br><br>At the end of the broadcast, world-renowned astrophysicist John Bahcall summarized the sentiments of the scientists watching: &#x201c;Every astronomer will remember where he or she was when they first heard the WMAP results. For cosmology, the announcement today represents a rite of passage from speculation to precision science.&#x201d; Bahcall&#x2019;s point was that not only are the measurements marvelously accurate, but they are also in astonishing agreement with what cosmologists had been expecting.<br><br>By the time of the WMAP announcement, most scientists had come to accept a cosmological theory known as the <i>inflationary model of the universe</i>. In scientific discussions, &#x201c;model&#x201d; is often used to mean &#x201c;theory,&#x201d; especially cases where the idea includes aspects that are qualitative or incomplete. The inflationary model, as the term is used today, refers to a combination of three concepts: the hot big bang model, developed in the early twentieth century; the inflation mechanism, introduced in the 1980s; and the dark energy hypothesis, added in the 1990s.<br><br>In this picture, the big bang itself is not explained. It is simply imagined that space and time emerged somehow. Next, it is assumed that just after the bang, a small region of the universe underwent a dramatic process called inflation, during which it expanded a googol (10 raised to the 100) times or more within a billionth of a billionth of a trillionth (10 raised to the negative 30) of a second. Once this period of inflation ended, the energy causing the inflation was transformed into a dense gas of hot radiation. The gas cooled and the expansion slowed, allowing atoms and molecules to clump into galaxies and stars. This picture of an inflationary universe was originally conceived in the 1980s and is now presented in many textbooks. However, recent astronomical discoveries have led to a major amendment to the story&#x2014;that 9 billion years after the big bang, a mysterious force called dark energy took over and started to accelerate the expansion again. In the standard picture, the expansion of the universe will accelerate forever, turning all of space into a vast and nearly perfect vacuum.<br><br>Both of us had been cosmologists for over two decades by the time of the WMAP announcement, and each had played a part in building the case for the leading view of the universe. In the 1980s, Paul was one of the architects of the original inflationary theory. A decade later, he and his Princeton University colleague Jeremiah Ostriker were among the first to incorporate dark energy into the big bang model. They showed that, assuming a particular mixture of matter and dark energy today, it is pos...</p><h2>My Time in Hawaii: A Polynesian Memoir</h2><p>Victoria Nelson&#39;s time in Hawaii began in 1969, when she stepped off a plane in Honolulu and found herself entranced by--even &#34;drowned&#34; in--a place of piercing beauty as well as a relentlessly funky down-to-earth diverse culture whose totemic automobile was a 1963 Plymouth Valiant and whose culinary expression was plate lunch at Zippy&#39;s drive-in.</p><p></p><h2>How a Shirt Grew in the Field</h2><p>Curious about where the cloth for his shirt comes from, Vasya watches as his father sows flax seeds, the flax seeds sprout and grow, and the plants are harvested and made into cloth by his mother and sisters.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: RussianKindergarten-Grade 2-- A newly illustrated edition of a story first published in 1967 (McGraw; o.p.). Vasya, a Ukrainian boy, is puzzled when his father tells him he is sowing flax seeds `` ` . . . so that shirts will grow for you and baby Anya.' '' How can a shirt grow in the field? The boy watches every step in the lengthy process of turning flax into linen cloth, from growing, harvesting, and processing it, to spinning and weaving the thread, to bleaching, cutting, and sewing together the fabric. And in the end (more than a year later), ``It was a real shirt!'' The new illustrations are softly colored paintings that show details of farm life and the changing seasons in the Ukrainian countryside; they're more realistic and less folkloric than Yaroslava's for the earlier edition. Both Elsa Beskow's Pelle's New Suit (HarperCollins, 1929) and Tomie dePaola's Charlie Needs a Cloak (S. &amp; S., 1982) show the similar process of turning wool into cloth. These titles have more child appeal because the protagonist himself helps to create the clothes, whereas Vasya is merely a passive observer while others work. However, where materials on farm life and textiles are in demand, this one will be a pleasant addition. --Caroline Parr, Central Rappahannock Regional Library, Fredericksburg, VA<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Millionaire and the Bard: Henry Folger&#39;s Obsessive Hunt for Shakespeare&#39;s First Folio</h2><p>The miraculous and romantic story of Shakespeare&#x2019;s First Folio, and of the American industrialist whose thrilling pursuit of the book became a lifelong obsession: &#x201c;Mays&#x2019;s narrative is so fast-moving, and peppered with such fascinating detail, it almost reads like a thriller&#x201d; (<i>Entertainment Weekly</i>, Grade: A).<br><br>When Shakespeare died in 1616, half of his plays died with him. No one&#x2014;not even their author&#x2014;believed that his writings would last. In 1623, seven years after his death, Shakespeare&#x2019;s business partners, companions, and fellow actors gathered copies of his plays and manuscripts and published thirty-six of them. This massive book, the First Folio, was intended as a memorial to their deceased friend. They could not have known that it would become one of the most important books ever published in the English language.<br> <br>Over two and a half centuries later, a young man fresh out of law school, Henry Folger, bought a book at auction&#x2014;a later, 1685 edition Fourth Folio, for $107.50. It was the beginning of an obsession that would consume the rest of his life. Folger rose to be president of Standard Oil, and he used his fortune to create the greatest Shakespeare collection in the world. By the time he died, Folger owned more First Folios than anyone and had founded the Folger Shakespeare Library, where his collection still resides.<br> <br>In <i>The Millionaire and the Bard</i>, Andrea Mays spins the tale of Shakespeare and of his collector, of the genius whose work we nearly lost, the men who had the foresight to preserve it, and the millionaire who, centuries later, was consumed by his obsession with it. &#x201c;Effortless in its unadorned storytelling and exacting in its research, this is a page-turning detective story&#x201d; (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>).</p><p>Andrea E. Mays has degrees in economics from the State University of New York at Binghamton and from UCLA, and teaches economics at California State University at Long Beach. Like Henry Folger, she is a native New Yorker and has had a lifelong Shakespeare obsession. She spent much of her Manhattan girlhood in the New York Public Library listening to vinyl LP recordings of performances by the Royal Shakespeare Company. <i>The Millionaire and the Bard</i> is her first book.The Millionaire and the Bard Prologue<p></p> <br><br> &#x201c;He was Not of an Age, but for All Time!&#x201d;<p></p> <br>&#x2014;BEN JONSON<br> <br>IT STARTED, as many great obsessions do, with an unremarkable incident, an encounter between a man and a book. It happened during the Gilded Age, in New York City. Henry Clay Folger was a recent graduate of Columbia Law School living in rented rooms, working as a clerk at a local oil refinery, and trying to make his way in the world.<br> <br>He walked into Bang&#x2019;s auction gallery in Manhattan with, as he later admitted, &#x201c;fear and trepidation.&#x201d;1 The books to be sold that day overflowed from the shelves. As an undergraduate at Amherst College he had studied literature, including Shakespeare, whose plays he &#x201c;read&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. far into the night.&#x201d;2 He had continued reading for pleasure ever since. He saved every book he ever read. He had always been a collector. At college, he made scrapbooks for his most trivial ephemera, including theater and lecture tickets. But his hoarder&#x2019;s impulse was still in search of a grand obsession.<br> <br>Henry had never bought a rare book. The closest he had ever come was when he purchased a gift for his young wife. She shared his literary enthusiasm, so he had bought her an inexpensive facsimile of the First Folio of the collected plays of William Shakespeare. He had never seen a real one. The old book that caught his eye at Bang&#x2019;s was not, however, a coveted First Folio published in 1623, but to his amateur&#x2019;s eye it seemed close. It was an authentic Fourth Folio, printed in 1685; it was a less valuable edition than a First. Its antiquity excited his fancy. He bid on the book until the auctioneer hammered it down to him for $107.50. He asked if he could pay in installments. When he took it home, he and his wife gazed at the familiar engraving of Shakespeare on the title page. They turned the thick, durable rag paper pages, and savored the familiar words of the plays they both loved, and which they had read many times before in cheap, modern editions. Holding that old book in his hands changed Henry Folger&#x2019;s life, just as the publication of its first edition more than two hundred fifty years earlier had come to define its author&#x2019;s.<br> <br>Soon, Folger found himself in the thrall of obsession. The young man who could barely afford a hundred-dollar book would spend a year&#x2019;s salary for another one, and devote the rest of his life, and millions of dollars, to chasing the rare books he coveted. The apprentice clerk would rise in the world of Gilded Age titans&#x2014;John D. Rockefeller, J. P. Morgan, Henry Huntington&#x2014;and join them in a frenzied competition for some of the rarest books in the world. Soon, he would own more volumes than he knew what to do with. They would overwhelm his shelves, his rented rooms, and then his home, and fill secret warehouses and storage lockers to their ceilings. Before long, Henry Folger&#x2019;s books would dominate his life. But in this ocean of books he prized one above all the others.<br> <br>Today, it is the most valuable book in the world. And, after the King James Bible, the most important. In October 2001, one of the First Folios sold at Christie&#x2019;s for more than six million dollars. No more than 750 copies were printed, and two-thirds of them have perished over the last 391 years. Around 244 of them survive, and most of those are incomplete. Shakespeare&#x2019;s First Folio&#x2014;Folger wanted to own them all.<br> <br>As Victor Hugo wrote, &#x201c;England has two books, one of which she has made, the other which has made her&#x2014;Shakespeare and the Bible.&#x201d; Published in London in 1623, Mr. William Shakespeares Comedies, Histories, &amp; Tragedies revolutionized the language, psychology, and culture of Western civilization. Without the First Folio, published seven years after the playwright&#x2019;s death, eighteen iconic works, including Macbeth, Measure for Measure, Julius Caesar, Antony and Cleopatra, Twelfth Night, The Winter&#x2019;s Tale, and The Tempest would have been lost.<br> <br>Recognizing that every folio was superficially the same book but that each surviving handmade copy was in fact unique with its own idiosyncratic typographical fingerprint, binding, and provenance, Folger decided that the only way to rediscover Shakespeare&#x2019;s original intentions and language&#x2014;what he called &#x201c;The True Text&#x201d;&#x2014;was to buy every copy he could find and subject it to meticulous comparative analysis.<br> <br>Believing that the mysteries of the folios could be fully understood only in the context of their time, he amassed an equally stupendous collection of artwork, books, letters, manuscripts, and antiquities from sixteenth- and seventeenth-century England. He wanted to own Shakespeare. And he did. He came to own more copies of the First Folio than anyone else in the world, more than even the British Library, the ultra-repository in Shakespeare&#x2019;s homeland. Folger collected more than twice the number of copies known to exist in all of England. How this happened is more than the tale of one passionate bibliophile. It is a story of the Old World giving way to the New, of the power of modern economics and transatlantic trade, and of the irresistible democratization of taste.<br> <br>Everyone knows William Shakespeare. He was born in 1564, and died in April 1616. He wrote approximately thirty-nine plays3 and composed five long poems and 154 sonnets. He failed to publish his collected works&#x2014;during his lifetime plays were considered ephemeral amusements, not serious literature. By the time of his death he was retired, was considered past his prime, and by the 1620s many of his plays were no longer regularly performed in theaters. No one&#x2014;not even Shakespeare himself&#x2014;believed that his writings would last, that he was a genius, or that future generations would celebrate him as the greatest and most influential writer in the history of the English language.<br> <br>Harold Bloom has argued that Shakespeare transformed the nature of man and created modern consciousness. If that is so, then the First Folio&#x2014;not the works of Darwin, Marx, or Freud&#x2014;is the urtext of modernism. If the Bible is the book of God, then Shakespeare is the book of man on earth. We use the words he invented, we speak in his cadences, and we think in his imagery. The epitaph that fellow poet Ben Jonson penned for William Shakespeare proved to be prophetic: &#x201c;He was not of an age, but for all time!&#x201d; Without the First Folio, the evolution from poet to secular saint would have never happened, and the story of that book is an incredible tale of faith, friendship, loyalty, and chance. Today, few people realize how close the world came, in the aftermath of Shakespeare&#x2019;s death, to losing half of his plays.<br> <br>Henry Clay Folger, however, remains one of the least-known industrial titans of his time. Folger, from the twilight years of the Gilded Age through the comet&#x2019;s arc of the Roaring Twenties, built the greatest Shakespeare library in the world, transporting it across the Atlantic piece by piece and hoarding it in thousands of unopened shipping crates, locked away in secret New York warehouses. And yet his life remains curiously unexamined. He is a forgotten man.<br> <br>This is a story of resurrection, of a magical book and two men, an American millionaire and an English playwright&#x2014;the man who coveted the First Folio, and the man who composed it.<br> <br></p><h2>What Remains</h2><p>Internationally acclaimed photographer Sally Mann offers a five-part meditation on mortality.</p><p>Sally Mann has won numerous awards, including three National Endowment for the Arts fellowships and a Guggenheim fellowship. Her photographs have been exhibited internationally and are in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. <br>Mann's previous collections, Immediate Family and At Twelve, recorded the bodies of children with a frank, slightly detached sensuality at a time when public hysteria around issues of child sexuality was sharply on the rise. The fact that many of the images were of her own children left Mann particularly vulnerable to charges of exploitation. But though controversial, what deflected such accusations was the serene flawlessness of Mann's pictorialist photographic technique, which somehow contained her very real provocation without necessarily resolving it. An even deeper sense of subtle disturbance pervades the four suites of photographs that make up this latest collection, whose subjects are mortality and death. In the two most graphic and difficult sequences, the remains of a beloved family dog and the corpses at a forensic lab are given equal emotional weight, equally luxuriant and pitiless memorialization. The difficult and time-consuming glass-plate process Mann employs, which results in an often dark, stressed and uneven surface, mirrors both the decay of the subjects and the movement of time that has claimed them. In another set, the almost invisible traces left by the death of a fugitive on Mann's property are recorded in washed-out images that convey with numb bleariness violence's psychic consequences. But in the book's most successful sequence-depicting the Civil War battlefield of Antietam-there are no literal traces of the dead at all, only an overwhelming psychic weight, which is reflected in intensely dark surfaces pocked with fissures and holes that at times resemble fields of stars laid over the barely visible hills, trees and fields. And if the last sequence, a series of extreme close-up portraits of Mann's (now grown) children, is less powerful by comparison, it provides the elegiac and loving coda to a book whose richness of presentation and sober subject matter work off of each other in varied and unexpected ways. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Believer&#39;s Secret of a Perfect Heart</h2><p>The great devotional writer Andrew Murray provides remarkable insight into Christ&#39;s puzzling command, &#34;be perfect&#34;.

According to Lampert, Nietzsche begins with a critique of philosophy that is ultimately affirmative, because it shows how philosophy can arrive at a defensible ontological account of the way of all beings. Nietzsche next argues that a new post-Christian religion can arise out of the affirmation of the world disclosed to philosophy. Then, turning to the implications of the new ontology for morality and politics, Nietzsche argues that these can be reconstituted on the fundamental insights of the new philosophy. Nietzsche&#39;s comprehensive depiction of this anti-Platonic philosophy ends with a chapter on nobility, in which he contends that what can now be publicly celebrated as noble in our species are its highest achievements of mind and spirit.</p><p>Laurence Lampert, professor of philosophy at Indiana University, Indianapolis, is also the author of Nietzsche&#39;s Teaching and Nietzsche and Modern Times, both published by Yale University Press, and Leo Strauss and Nietzsche."A masterpiece of insightful commentary and a brilliant interpretation of one of Nietzsche's richest--and most poorly understood--books." -- <i>Graham Parkes, University of Hawaii</i></p><h2>Providence Act 2 Limited Edition Hardcover</h2><p>The second arc of Providence is unveiled in this special hardcover-only edition.

Some kind of city sweat was oozing up through the sidewalk cracks, shimmering with oily rainbows in the streetlights. The garbage piled up outside the restaurants on Indian Row was seeping, leftover curry turning into slurry. The glistening plastic bags would smell jaw-droppingly foul the next morning, but as I walked past that night, they still gave off the perfumes of saffron and freshly thrown-out rice. <br><br>The people were sweating too&#x2014;shiny-faced and frizzy-haired, like everyone had just stepped out of a shower. Eyes were glassy, and cell phones dangled limply on wrist straps, softly glowing, spitting occasional fragments of bubblegum songs. <br><br>I was on my way home from practicing with Zahler. It was way too hot to write anything new, so we&#x2019;d riffed, plowing through the same four chords a thousand times. After an hour the riff had faded from my ears, like it does when you say the same word over and over till it turns meaningless. Finally, all I could hear was the squeak of Zahler&#x2019;s sweaty fingers on his strings and his amp hissing like a steam-pipe, another music squeezing up through ours. <br><br>We pretended we were a band warming up onstage, slowly revving the crowd into a frenzy before the lead singer jumps into the spotlights: the World&#x2019;s Longest Intro. But we didn&#x2019;t have a lead singer, so the riff just petered out into rivulets of sweat. <br><br>I sometimes feel it right before something big happens&#x2014;when I&#x2019;m about to break a guitar string, or get caught sneaking in, or when my parents are this close to having a monster fight. <br><br>So just before the TV fell, I looked up. <br><br>The woman was twenty-something, with fire-engine red hair and raccoon eyes, black makeup streaming down her cheeks. She pushed a television through her third-floor window, an old boxy one, its power cord flailing as it tumbled toward the sidewalk. The TV clipped a fire escape, the deep ringing sound swallowed seconds later by the crash on the pavement twenty feet ahead of me. <br><br>A spray of shattered glass skittered around my feet, glittering and sharp, tinkling like colliding chandeliers as shards rolled and skidded to a halt. Fragments of streetlight and sky reflected up from them, as if the television had split into a thousand tiny screens, all still working. My own eye stared back at me from a Manhattan-shaped sliver. Wide and awestruck, it blinked. <br><br>The next thing I did was look straight up. You know, in case everyone was throwing out TVs that night, and I should roll under a parked car. But it was just her&#x2014;she was letting out long, wordless screams now and throwing out more stuff: <br><br>Pillows with tasseled edges. Dolls and desk lamps. Books fluttering like crash-landing birds. A jar full of pens and pencils. Two cheap wooden chairs, smashed first against the window frame so they&#x2019;d fit through. A computer keyboard that sent up a splash of keys and tiny springs. Silverware glittering as it tumbled, ringing on the pavement like a triangle when dinner&#x2019;s ready . . . a whole apartment squeezed out one window. Somebody&#x2019;s life laid bare. <br><br>And all the while she was shrieking like a beast above us. <br><br>I looked around at the gathering crowd, most of them getting out late from Indian Row, addled by curry. The rapt expressions on their upturned faces made me jealous. The whole time Zahler and I had jammed, I&#x2019;d been imagining an audience like this one: flabbergasted and electrified, yanked out of the everyday by their ears and eyeballs. And now this crazy woman, with her rock-star hair and makeup, had them mesmerized. Why bother with riffs and solos and lyrics when all the crowd wanted was an avalanche of screams and smashed Ikea furniture? <br><br>But once the shock wore off, their rapture faded into something uglier. Soon enough, people were laughing and pointing, a gang of boys shouting, &#x201c;Jump, jump, jump!&#x201d; in rhythm. A camera flash popped, catching a satanic flicker in the woman&#x2019;s eyes. A couple of faces glowed with blue cell-phone light&#x2014;calling the police, or nearby friends to come and join in? I wondered. <br><br>One of the spectators slipped into the impact zone, running half-crouched to snatch a black dress from under a rain of computer cables and extension cords. She backed away, holding it up to her body as if she&#x2019;d pulled it off a rack. Another ducked in to snag an armload of magazines. <br><br>&#x201c;Hey!&#x201d; I yelled. I was about to point out that this wasn&#x2019;t exactly Dumpster diving&#x2014;the woman might want her stuff back after this psychotic meltdown was over&#x2014;but then the CDs started flying. Glittering projectiles spattered on the street like plastic hail, each one impelled from the window by a shriek. <br><br>The looters retreated&#x2014;the woman was aiming now, and the CDs were deadly. I mean, compact discs don&#x2019;t hurt much, but these were still in their cases, giving them extra weight and corners. <br><br>Then I saw it: the neck of an electric guitar emerging from the window, then the whole instrument&#x2014;a mid-seventies Fender Stratocaster with gold pickups and whammy bar, a creamy yellow body with a white pick-guard. <br><br>I took a step forward, holding one hand up. &#x201c;Wait!&#x201d; <br><br>The madwoman glared down at me, mascara smeared across her face like black blood, clutching the Stratocaster to her chest. Her hands found the strings, as if she was about to play, and then she let out one last terrible howl. <br><br>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; I shouted. <br><br>She let the guitar drop. <br><br>It spun in the air, delicate tuning hardware glittering in the streetlights. I was already running, tripping on smashed plastic and tangled clothes, thinking that there were four hundred bones in my two hands, wondering how many of them that lacquered hardwood would break after a thirty-foot fall. <br><br>But I couldn&#x2019;t just let it smash. . . . <br><br>Then the miracle: the guitar snapped to a halt in midair. Its strap was caught on a corner of the fire escape, where it hung, spinning perilously. <br><br>I skidded to a halt, looking straight up. <br><br>&#x201c;Over here!&#x201d; someone shouted. <br><br>I glanced down for a split second: a girl my age, with short black hair and red-framed glasses, yanking something big and flat from under the clutter, sending silverware scattering in all directions. <br><br>&#x201c;Watch out,&#x201d; I said, pointing up toward where the Strat was untangling itself. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s about to fall.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I know! Take the other side!&#x201d; <br><br>I glanced back down at her, frowning. The girl was holding two corners of a blanket she&#x2019;d rescued from the pile. She unfurled its plaid expanse toward me with a flick, as if we were making a bed. I grabbed for the other corners, finally understanding. We stepped back from each other, pulling the blanket taut, looking up again. Above us, the guitar spun faster and faster, like a kid unwinding on a swing set. <br><br>&#x201c;Be careful,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a nineteen seventy-three . . . Um, what I mean is, it&#x2019;s really valuable.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;With gold pickups?&#x201d; she snorted. &#x201c;Nineteen seventy-five, maybe.&#x201d; <br><br>I looked down at her. <br><br>&#x201c;Incoming!&#x201d; she yelled. <br><br>The guitar slipped free, still spinning, hardware glittering, strap flailing. It landed heavy as a dead body between us, almost jerking the blanket from my fists. Its momentum pulled us both forward a few skidding steps, suddenly face to face. <br><br>But there was no awful thud; the Stratocaster hadn&#x2019;t struck pavement. <br><br>&#x201c;We saved it!&#x201d; Her brown eyes were glowing. <br><br>I looked down at the guitar, safely swaddled in plaid. &#x201c;Whoa. We did.&#x201d;Then the fire escape rang out again. Both of us flinched as we looked up. But it wasn&#x2019;t more stuff falling&#x2014;it was a pair of human figures, six stories above, descending toward the crazy woman&#x2019;s window. They weren&#x2019;t climbing down the metal stairs, though&#x2014;they were practically flying, swinging from handhold to handhold, graceful as headlight shadows slipping across a ceiling. <br><br>I watched them, awestruck, until the girl next to me shouted two terrifying words: <br><br>&#x201c;Toaster oven!&#x201d; <br><br>It was tumbling out the window directly over our heads, glass door hanging open, scattering crumbs. . . . <br><br>We bundled the Stratocaster into its blanket and ran.</p><h2>The Mists of Avalon</h2><p>876 paged paperback &#34;The Mists of Avalon&#34; by Marion Zimmer Bradley.</p><p>Even readers who don't normally enjoy Arthurian legends will love this version, a retelling from the point of view of the women behind the throne. Morgaine (more commonly known as Morgan Le Fay) and Gwenhwyfar (a Welsh spelling of Guinevere) struggle for power, using Arthur as a way to score points and promote their respective worldviews. <i>The Mists of Avalon</i>'s Camelot politics and intrigue take place at a time when Christianity is taking over the island-nation of Britain; Christianity vs. Faery, and God vs. Goddess are dominant themes. <p>Young and old alike will enjoy this magical Arthurian reinvention by science fiction and fantasy veteran Marion Zimmer Bradley. <i>--Bonnie Bouman</i></p>I love this book. Plain and simple: It's the absolute best retelling of the Arthurian legend I've ever read. Over the years, I've given copies to everyone close to me. I haven't reread it in years, but I must still talk about it, because when I was in Ireland and my husband commented to my 8-year-old daughter (who hasn't read it...yet!) that there are no snakes in Ireland, she piped up that the snakes that were supposedly driven out of Ireland by Saint Patrick were actually the Druid priests, whose wrists were encircled with snake tattoos. And that it's just a natural phenomenon that there are no native Irish snakes.

Marrett started the Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards AFB only two weeks after the school's commander, Col. Chuck Yeager, ejected from a Lockheed NF-104 trying to set a world altitude record. He describes life as a space cadet experiencing 15 Gs in a human centrifuge, zero-G maneuvers in a KC-135 'Vomit Comet,' and a flight to 80,000 feet in a Lockheed F-104A Starfighter. After graduating from Yeager's 'Charm School,' he was assigned to the Fighter Branch of Flight Test Operations for three years. There he flew the Air Force's latest fighter aircraft and chased other test aircraft like the X-15 rocket ship and the XB-70A Valkyrie as they set world speed and altitude records. <br><p>Marrett takes you into the cockpit with him going vertical in a T-38 Talon, high-G maneuvering in an F-4C Phantom and wet runway landing tests in the accident-prone F-111A Aardvark. Marrett relives stories of crashes when his test pilot friends were killed. He writes about Air Force test pilot Col. 'Silver Fox' Stephens setting a world speed record in the YF-12 Blackbird and Lockheed test pilot Bob Gilliland flying a single-engine, minimum-control speed stall in the SR-71 spy plane. He recounts dead-sticking a T-38 to a landing on Rogers Dry Lake after a twin-engine failure and conducting dangerous tail hook barrier testing in a fighter jet without a canopy. Marrett also writes about a UFO sighting in the night sky above the Mojave Desert, a mysterious sighting now referred to as 'The Edwards Encounter.'</p></p><p><b>George J.

Only a select group of men knew the truth. Among them were the twelve submariners chosen to embark on the first missions of the NR-1 - one of whom was Lee Vyborny. This is his story. </p><p>In 1966, when the United States lost a hydrogen bomb off the coast of Spain, retrieving it took eighty days and at least three deep-diving submersibles. The unacceptable length of time it took to avoid a near disaster gave Admiral Hyman Rickover, the "father of the nuclear navy," an irrefutable reason to forge ahead on the development of the craft he'd been working on for more than a year. One that could do the job again if needed - and much more. With every aspect of its conception and its abilities overseen, studied, and scrutinized by Rickover, his intensely personal project would be a 400-ton submarine equipped with a custom-built miniature nuclear reactor and designed to dive deeper than any other submarine, traversing the untouched ocean floor on Goodyear tires. Such depths would also mean that the crew would be cut off from all possible rescue should something go wrong. It was impossibly expensive, extraordinarily dangerous, and, as a secret weapon, completely unarmed! . For the American military, the state-of-the-art submersible, christened the NR-1, would be the most closely guarded - and revolutionary - secret of the Cold War. </p><p>Through eyewitness accounts from the engineers and the original crew - all of whom were trained to do everyone else's jobs - and from the NR-1's conception through its initial decade of operation to its still-active performance today as one of the oldest U.S. Navy nuclear-powered submarines still in service, "Dark Waters" lifts the cloud of mystery from one of America's best kept secrets with the full story told here for the first time. It recounts not only the incredible, classified missions of the men aboard the secret submarine, but the human aspects as well; the rigorous mental and physical training, the clashes of personalities, the pride in and heart-stopping fear of pushing the technological envelope, and the thrill of going where no man had gone before - to pull off the impossible and beat the odds time and time again.</p><p>Lee Vybornyhas been involved with the U.S. Navy submarine force for over 30 years, serving aboard a fast attack submarine and being chosen as one of the original 12 crew members on the NR-1. He was an instructor at the Nuclear Power Training Unit in Windsor, CT and a Navy diver. He later became a design and production engineer at the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics, and a program manager for the development and production of navigational equipment at Sperry Aerospace and Marine Systems. He is now retired.</p> <br><p>Don Davishas written or cowritten eleven books. Three of his books have become <b>New York Times</b> bestsellers.

Abruptly in the midst of the atrocity, the Kluxers are interrupted by a mysterious rider who's a deadly shot with both his pistols and long-range Sharps buffalo rifle. It's the feared and hated (by the KKK, at least) Red Mask, a tough, lethal, black man who wisely keeps his identity concealed.....

His hardcore, hard-nosed sense of social conscience remains intact. -- <i>Ed Bryant, Locus, May, 1999</i></p></p><h2>The Divine Dance: The Trinity and Your Transformation</h2><p><b>Invitation to a Dance&nbsp; </b><br> The Trinity is supposed to be the central, foundational doctrine of our entire Christian belief system, yet we're often told that we shouldn't attempt to understand it because it is a "mystery." Should we presume to try to breach this mystery? If we could, how would it transform our relationship with God and renew our lives?<br><br> The word <i>Trinity </i>is not found in the New Testament&#x2014;it wasn't until the third century that early Christian father Tertullian coined it&#x2014;but the idea of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit was present in Jesus' life and teachings and from the very beginning of the Christian experience.<br><br> In the pages of this book, internationally recognized teacher Richard Rohr circles around this most paradoxical idea as he explores the nature of God&#x2014;circling around being an apt metaphor for this mystery we're trying to apprehend. Early Christians who came to be known as the "Desert Mothers and Fathers" applied the Greek verb <i>perichoresis </i>to the mystery of the Trinity. The best translation of this odd&#x2013;sounding word is dancing. Our word choreography comes from the same root. Although these early Christians gave us some highly conceptualized thinking on the life of the Trinity, the best they could say, again and again, was, Whatever is going on in God is a flow&#x2014;it's like a dance.<br><br> But God is not a dancer&#x2014;He is the dance itself. That idea might sound novel, but it is about as traditional as you can get. God is the dance itself, and He invites you to be a part of that dance. Are you ready to join in?</p><p><b>Fr.

This human dance we're all in reflects a mysterious divine dance, one that we notice on our best days. Finding the sweet spot where contemporary science meets ancient mysticism, and theology meets poetry, <i>The Divine Dance </i>sketches a beautiful choreography for a life well-lived. In our joy or our pain, true life is always relational, a flow, a dance. (And was always meant to be.)<br> --Bono, U2<br>Seriously friends, this is Richard in peak form, doing what he does best: showing you how the best ideas for the future have actually been here, in the Jesus tradition, the whole time. In these pages it's the Trinity--that old familiar word--that suddenly gets infused with insight and electricity as you see just how practical and helpful and healing and inspiring and provocative and dangerous this conception of the Divine is. Our favorite Franciscan has done it again!<br> --Rob Bell<br> Speaker, teacher, and author, <i>Love Wins</i><br> RobBell.com<br><br>More and more people are struggling with conventional understandings of God, like the big white guy on a throne with a long beard and a fistful of swords and lightning bolts by which you (or your enemies) might be smitten at any moment if you don't think or act correctly. For many, the concept of Trinity simply triples their God-problems. But in <i>The Divine Dance</i>, Richard Rohr and Mike Morrell explore the Trinity as a pathway beyond problematic understandings of God. This beautifully-written book can do far more than change your troubled thoughts about God: it can change your way of thinking about God entirely.<br> --Brian D. McLaren<br> Activist, speaker, and author, <i>We Make the Road by Walking</i><br> brianmclaren.net<br>Rohr and Morrell have given us a liberating and yet totally orthodox invitation into the life of God. This book is a celebration of the Trinity, not as bad math (1+1+1=3), and not as baffling mystery to avoid, but as the divine movement of love. I'm grateful for a book that speaks God not with pretense and jargon, but with wisdom and genuine human experience. <i>The Divine Dance</i> is an example of why Rohr has had such a profound influence on so many Christians seeking to balance reason and mystery, action and contemplation, not to mention faith and real life.<br> --Nadia Bolz-Weber<br> Pastor, House for All Sinners and Saints<br> Author, <i>Accidental Saints: Finding God in All the Wrong People</i><br> NadiaBolzWeber.com<br><i>The Divine Dance</i> reminds us that God is a holy community--Father, Son, Spirit. And that humanity is created in the image of community, with a deep longing to love and be loved. This book calls us to be like God--to belong to each other, to be one as God is one, and to refuse to do life alone.<br> --Shane Claiborne<br> Activist and author, <i>Jesus for President</i><br> RedLetterChristians.org<br>It's ironic that, while we have many religious institutions named after the Trinity, we are increasingly plagued by feelings of isolation and loneliness because we fail to truly experience this mysterious Three-In-One. With wisdom, compassion, and deep theological insight, Rohr and Morrell help readers begin to hear the music, understand the invitation, and feel the joy that leads our souls to enter into the Divine Dance.<br> --Sarah Thebarge<br> Author, <i>The Invisible Girls</i><br> SarahThebarge.com<br>Richard Rohr is one of the great spiritual masters of our time, indeed of any time. His superb new book on the Trinity is vintage Rohr: clearheaded, provocative, inspiring, challenging, and, most of all, suffused with the presence of the Holy Spirit.

It is in all ways comprehensive: its text is as organized and complete as a set of blueprints; its striking pictures of projects as small as the modest Usonian houses or as grand as the Guggenheim Museum are arranged in order by the visual information they reveal about each project; and even its copyediting is noticeably coherent, with dates just where one expects such details to be, in the first picture captions for each project. The book as a whole is so carefully conceived that, reading it, one knows exactly where to look for any particular bit of history. And while, for casual readers, the essays may offer too much to digest at first, Robert McCarter's prose is agile and passionate. "Wright understood buildings to be the background or framework for human existence," he writes. "Architecture gave dignity to daily life." <i>--Margaret Moorman</i>Part of a series that aims to place buildings within their historical context, this text considers Wright&#39;s Unity Temple, Barnsdall House and Johnson Wax Administration Building. It includes specially produced technical drawings that explain how the buildings were detailed and put together. The text explains how together, the three buildings provide an insight into Wright&#39;s approach to design throughout his career, and into his aptitude for designing in three entirely different fields of architecture: office, residential and church design.</p><h2>The Pumpkin Rollers</h2><p>In the cattle drives of the Old West, pumpkin rollers were green farmboys, almost more trouble than they were worth.<br><br>When Trey McLean leaves his family's East Texas cotton farm and sets off on his own to learn the cattleman's trade, he's about as green as they come.

He grew up on a ranch near Crane, Texas, and earned a journalism degree from the University of Texas. His first novel, <i>Hot Iron</i>, was published in 1956. Among his awards have been seven Spurs from Western Writers of America and four Western Heritage awards from the National Cowboy Hall of Fame. His novel <i>The Good Old Boys</i> was made into a television film starring Tommy Lee Jones. In addition to his novels, Kelton worked as an agricultural journalist for 42 years, and served in the infantry in World War II. He died in 2009.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pumpkin Rollers<br>ONE&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Since about the time Andrew Jackson whipped the British at New Orleans two weeks after the War of 1812 had officially ended, it had been McLean family tradition to register births, marriages and deaths in a big leather-bound Bible. The Book was already a considerable repository of family history by the time James Wilton McLean's mother added his name in a studied hand a decade before the War of Northern Aggression.After that, few occasions arose for his full name to be written down. His domino-playing father hung the nickname Trey upon him because he was the third-born son. It clung like an East Texas chigger.It had become family tradition also that each son except for the firstborn would strike out on his own when he became old enough and big enough to whip his father. There was not room for more than one grown son to remain on the family's small blackland farm. That dubious privilege went to the oldest. Trey McLean was not certain he could whip Pap, and even less certain that he wanted to try.So, turning his back on tradition, he said good-bye to his weeping mother and frowning father, venturing forth upon a wagon road that meandered off in a generally westward direction past the cotton gin and the gristmill, across the river and on toward that awesome, mysterious country most people simply called "out west." He wore a floppy farmer-boy hat that might have looked good on a scarecrow. The brown horse he rode matched his age and trailed four cows that would never be ten years old again. That was the sum of his accumulated wealth, earned laboring for neighbors when his father could spare him from the plow and the pitchfork, the cotton sack and the corn-heading knife.Trey realized that four cows of such mature years offered at best a slow start toward a fortune, but a weak fence had allowed all to consort freely with a neighbor's black bull. In proper season he could expect his head count to double. He had been assured that somewhere to the west of Fort Worth he should find free grazing on land to which no one had yet established any legal claim.He saw one potential complication. The Comanches and the Kiowas had not yielded to the army's insistence that they repair to the reservation. They were not ready to entrust their future welfare to Uncle Sam's bald-headed nephews who administered the Indian agency. But Trey had faith. Though he had been too young to fight for the Confederacy's lost cause, he had taken over the job of bringing wild meat to the family table while his oldest brother fought the war. He claimed he could knock the left eye out of a squirrel as far as he could see it wink. He figured Indians would have the good judgment to respect marksmanship and leave him and his livestock alone.Besides, as slow as these cows walked, it was going to be a long while before they muddied their feet at the banks of the Brazos or the Colorado, or whatever other western watercourse he settled upon. The army's spokesmen kept promising they would soon force the wild tribes to yield.The same people had vowed to bring the South to heel in a month.Trey would not allow his high spirits to be dampened by concern about Indians anyway. He was too excited over the prospect of being truly free for the first time, responsible only for himself, adventuring into a new land where years of cotton had not yet wearied the soil and sapped it of strength. There, the newspapers claimed, the only limits to a man's prospects were his willingness to work and the size of his dream.Trey had always been a hard worker, and his dream was as big as the cloudless sky under which he rode on this shining spring day.Tied behind his saddle was the canvas war bag his brother had carried to Virginia and back. It remained in good shape except for two Yankee bullet holes, battlefield-mended in rough fashion. It contained a change of long-handled underwear, one homespun shirt and a pair of pants a little shorter than Trey's long legs. On his feet were the only boots he owned, homemade, bull-stout and hog-ugly, with a ten-dollar gold piece sewn into the top of one for emergencies. Hanging in two cotton sacks on either side of the saddle were flour, salt and coffee beans, a slab of fat bacon, a skillet and a can to boil coffee in. As for meat, he had no doubt he could live on the results of his marksmanship. That meant rabbit and squirrel now, perhaps venison and buffalo once he passed the heavily settled, heavily hunted East Texas settlements.He had seventeen dollars Yankee in his pocket to meet whatever contingencies might arise. All in all, he felt he had a running start toward a career as a cattle baron.His father did not share Trey's optimism. Pap had never taken into proper account that Trey was four years younger than his oldest brother and two years younger than the next. He had expected Trey to keep up with them in the amount of labor he could accomplish between daylight and dark. Thus, he had rarely acknowledged meritin his third-born son. A pattern of automatic criticism had become too deeply ingrained to change though Trey had grown to be the tallest and strongest of them all.Trey had tried not to let his father's pessimism slow him, but at times the disparaging words burrowed beneath his confidence like a gopher undermining a cornerstone. He needed reassurance from time to time to shore up what Pap had undercut."You won't get fifty miles with them cows," Pap had declared. "They'll run off or get stole. You'll come draggin' back with the seat of your britches out and your belly thinkin' your throat's been cut.""Bet you!" Trey had proven Pap's dire predictions wrong in the past, especially since he had finally outreached his brothers in length of leg and arm and hardness of muscle. He was determined to do it again.And he did. He made it <i>seventy</i> miles before he lost the cows.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>He was in an itch to hurry a lot of distance between himself and the black, gummy soil of the McLean homeplace, but he found there was a limit to how fast four long-aged cows would willingly travel, especially when their ribs were beginning to spring in their pregnancy. He carried a bullwhip on his saddle but did not like to use it. He had no wish to inflict pain upon his property. It seemed to do little good anyway. Like a mule, the cows had a way in their bovine stubbornness of rushing their hind legs a little when he pressed them, while their front legs kept going at the same stolid pace.After a while he gave up the effort to hurry them and reconciled himself to spending the first night at the farm of Pap's brother, Uncle Matthew, eight miles up the wagon road.Uncle Matthew was all right; he had often taken Trey's side when Pap had criticized him for one perceived shortcoming or another. But one could not take Uncle Matthew without accepting Aunt Maudie as well, and Aunt Maudie could talk until Trey's ears hurt. Uncle Matthewhad taken refuge in deafness, though Trey had noted that he seemed to hear fairly well when he wanted to. His impairment was selective.As Trey had feared, Aunt Maudie told him a hundred reasons why he should give up the foolish notion of going west and becoming a cattleman. She was firm in her conviction that herdsmen in general were indolent agents of Lucifer, while hardworking tillers of the soil were the meek God had chosen to inherit the earth. Besides, she said, it would be a hundred years before the country west of Fort Worth ever became anything other than a godless wilderness, and even a young man like Trey would never enjoy such a life span, especially out there where savage Comanches had free run. His life was likely to be as short as a dirt dauber's, she said.Uncle Matthew said little in her presence, but next morning as he opened the gate to let the four cows out of his hay lot he took his old black pipe from his mouth and pointed west with the stem of it. "This was a raw country too when me and your pap put Tennessee behind us. We took ahold and made somethin' out of it. Now, you got the makin's to do better than him or me either one. You ain't got much to start with, so there ain't no way you can go but up. Do it, and make us proud."Trey gathered up all the confidence he could muster. To prove his father wrong and his uncle right, he told himself he would ride through hell and out its far side.He did not realize how short a trip it could be to hell. At the slow pace the cows set for him, it took about a week.Trey had never known much about law or lawmen. Pap had always figured the less government there was, the better. That started with the county courthouse and held all the way to Washington City. Trey had only a nodding acquaintance with the local sheriff. An officer of the law always made him a little nervous, as if he had done something wrong that he didn't even know about but the officer did.He had never been more than a few miles west of his Uncle Matthew'sfarm, so by noon of the second day he was among strangers in a strange country. By the end of a slow week he didn't even know the name of the county he was traversing. He stayed on or near the heaviest-traveled road that led west, and when he came to a fork where he couldn't tell the difference, he let the cows graze while he waited for somebody to come along and give him proper directions. He found most people friendly, inclined to tarry and jaw a spell.He was not concerned, then, when a farmer rode up behind him in a buggy whose springs sagged under what must have been three hundred and fifty pounds of pure lard. The farmer's eyes were half hidden behind a roll of fat at the top of puffy cheeks that vibrated like pudding. He had the voice of a man speaking from the bottom of a well. "Where'd you come by these good cows, young fellow?"Trey saw no reason not to tell him. On the contrary, he was proud of the fact. "Bought them with the savin's from my labor. I'm takin' them out west to start me a herd.""No two of them seem to have the same brand.""They come off of four different farms. I ain't figured out a brand of my own yet.""You got any kin in this county? Any friends?""They're all sixty-seventy miles behind me. I don't know a soul around here."He wondered why the farmer seemed pleased at that. Most folks tended to cluck in sympathy at the thought of his passing through a land of strangers, a pilgrim in the wilderness.The farmer pointed. "You stay on this main road. You'll come to a fork a couple of miles farther on. Be sure and bear to the right. I expect you'd like to spend the night in town."Trey hadn't so far. He had been managing about sundown each evening to find a farmhouse and somebody willing to let him pen his cows for the night. Most of them invited him to supper. In town they would want money for that. But he thanked the farmer anyway and watched the man put the large buggy horse into a long trot, laboringon ahead. He pitied the animal its heavy load.The first sign of the town was the courthouse clock tower, standing taller than anything else on the horizon. He estimated that it was an hour to sundown and about that long to the edge of town. He could see a couple of people riding toward him, one on horseback and one in a buggy, but he thought little of it. He was used to meeting travelers along the road. After a time he recognized the farmer. The horsebacker was a stranger. He looked like a farmer too, about the same age as Pap. Not until he was near enough to address Trey without shouting did Trey notice the badge pinned to the man's shirt pocket. Immediately he felt that old welling-up of guilt, though he had nothing to feel guilty about.The officer did not say "Hello" or "How do?" or any such pleasantry. He just rode a slow, thoughtful circle around the cows, which gladly took the opportunity to drop their heads into the grass and begin stuffing their paunches."I see four different brands here on four different cows. Where's your brand?" he demanded."Ain't decided on one yet.""If you don't have your own brand, how do you know they're your cows?"That seemed a foolish question to Trey. The officer probably knew more about plows than cows, this being cotton country. "By their marks and their colors and their general looks, same as I know people," Trey answered."You got any papers with you to prove ownership?"A hard look in the lawman's narrowed eyes began to worry Trey. "There never was no papers. I just paid the money and got the cows."The officer jerked his head toward the farmer in the buggy. "Mr. Lige Connors here, he says they're his cows.""He may say so, but he's wrong."The farmer leaned forward, making the buggy springs creak. His jowls shook. "You callin' me a liar, young fellow?"Trey felt the stirrings of anxiety. "I'm sayin' you're mistaken."The farmer pointed at the nearest cow. "They're mine, Micah. See that one with the twisted horn? I'd know that spotted hide if I seen it in a tan yard."Anger coursed through Trey as he realized the farmer was flat-out trying to steal his cows. That was one sin. He was swearing false witness. That was two. Old Preacher Featherstone back home would have his work cut out for him, trying to pray this man back from the brink of perdition.The sheriff declared gravely, "I'm takin' these cows into custody. And you too, young man. We take a mighty poor view around here of men who try to get off with other people's stock."Even as Trey shouted, "They're my cows!" he saw the futility of it. In a wildly irrational moment he tried to put the cows into a run, but they had long since gotten past any fear of him. They moved two or three steps and dropped their heads into the grass again. They seemed willing allies to their own abduction.The sheriff's voice was calm, as if he did this every day. "Now, son, I've got a pair of handcuffs here, but they got a way of gallin' a man's wrists. You can come along peaceful and help me drive these cows into town, or I can cuff you to my saddle and make you walk alongside me all the way. I ought to tell you, this old horse of mine is bad to kick.""I can prove by my Uncle Matthew that these cows belong to me. I can prove it by my pa.""They got paper to back up their word?" The sheriff waited for the answer, though he knew what it would be. "It'd come down to their statements against Mr. Connors's, and they're strangers here. Everybody in this county knows Lige Connors.""I'll bet they do!"The farmer was so jubilant over acquiring four cows without cost that he paid no notice to the implied insult.The sheriff pointed toward town. "Them cows've got calves inthem, so push them gentle, son. Have respect for other people's property."&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The iron door clanged shut behind him with an impact that seemed to shake the stone jailhouse. The sound carried a brutal finality that sent shivers down Trey's spine. He had never seen the inside of a jailhouse before, much less the inside of a locked cell. He had accepted Pap's admonition that a man who stayed out of saloons, houses of ill repute and their like need never find himself in that kind of trouble. But his father had never had his cows coveted by a man to whom truth was a stranger.Farmer Connors watched as the sheriff turned the key in the lock.

Their every move attracts headlines. Now Kitty Kelley has gone behind the scenes at Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle and Kensington Palace to raise the curtain on the men and women who make up the British royal family. Queen Elizabeth, Prince Charles, Princess Diana...here are the scandals of the last decades: the doomed marriages and the husbands, wives, lovers and children caught in their wake and damaged beyond repair. No one is spared.<br></p><p>The audiocassette version of Kitty Kelley's <i>The Royals</i> is abridged, which means you just get the good stuff. Kelley herself reads, purring cattily along, narrating the downstairs gossip about the upstairs Windsors. Here's Queen Elizabeth insisting her 17 Welsh corgis appear on a TV special, and Prince Charles snatching one last rendezvous with Camilla Parker-Bowles on the eve of his marriage to Diana Spencer. The dish is delish, but after listening too long, it gets harder to sneer along with Kitty as the Royal Family takes on more tragic dimensions. The greatest crime a Windsor can commit is not infidelity, drunkenness, or unusual sexual practices. No, the worst sin is going before the public, as both Diana and Charles did in the aftermath of their stormy marriage, and telling people about it. For the Windsors, it seems, anything goes. Anything that is, but indiscretion.They are the most chronicled family on the face of the globe. Their every move attracts headlines. Scores of books have tried and failed to penetrate the royal facade. Now Kitty Kelley, bestselling author of <i>Nancy Reagan: The Unauthorized Biography</i> and <i>His Way: The Unauthorized Biography of Frank Sinatra</i>, has gone behind palace walls to provide the first three-dimensional, comprehensive, and even-handed portrait of the men and women who make up the British royal family.<p> Kelley, the most fearless biographer of our time, spent more than four years investigating the royal family. In addition to meticulous research into documented sources, she conducted hundreds of exclusive interviews with past and present employees of the royal household, royal friends and relations, courtiers, members of Parliament, and other intimate observers. The author has unveiled and examined the private lives of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, Queen Elizabeth II, Princess Margaret, Prince Phillip, Prince Charles, Princess Diana, Prince Andrew, and Sarah, the Duchess of York, as well as their forebears and predecessors, as no other biographer has been able to do.</p><p> Kitty Kelley has raised the curtain on this most secretive family. Here are lonely royal children brought up without a proper education in isolated and artificial surroundings, twentieth-century adolescents with nineteenth-century touchstones. Here are the sexual ambiguities, the alcoholism, gambling, and womanizing that were common in the House of Windsor long before Prince Charles married Lady Diana Spencer. No one is spared; here are the scandals of the last decades: the doomed marriages and the husbands, wives, lovers and children caught in their wake and damaged beyond repair.</p><p> Illuminating the Windsors' arrogance, naivete, and lusts as well as hard work, dedication, and the ability to survive the most humiliating disclosures, <i>The Royals</i> is Kitty Kelley's richest, most iconoclastic, historically significant, and compelling book. She smashes the images created by palace bureaucrats and perpetuated by our own fantasies. Yet she introduced readers to people they can understand and will never forget.</p></p><h2>Giving Birth to Thunder, Sleeping With His Daughter: Coyote Builds North America</h2><p>Prankster, warrior, seducer, fool -- Old Man Coyote is the most enduring legend in Native American culture.

Annotation c. by Book News, Inc., Portland, Or.</p><p>The Dallas Museum has been very busy fulfilling its mandate to educate the public, producing two books about its own collection of ancient art and publishing one about a traveling exhibit Dallas organized of the University of Pennsylvania's ancient Egyptian collection. The most extensive of the three books is the massive exhibition catalog, Searching for Ancient Egypt. A short history of the University of Pennsylvania Museum and its excavations puts everything into perspective. Seven essays by eminent scholars such as William Kelly Simpson and David O'Connor examine all aspects of Egyptian art, architecture, and crafts from the sacred to the mundane. If the illustrations are as excellent overall as the two samples sent with the galleys, they will add excellent detail to the text. The other two catalogs focus on elements of Dallas's own ancient art collection. Curator Bromberg and Kilinski (Jupiter's Loves &amp; His Children, Univ. of Georgia, 1997) are well qualified to review ancient history and culture through its surviving artifacts in the Dallas Museum's modest collection. Independent scholar Deppert-Lippitz focuses solely on Dallas's lovely jewelry, beautifully illustrated here (how the gold does shine!). These holdings are a recent acquisition of outstanding quality that raises Dallas's collection in ancient art from small but elegant to one of importance in the study of the history of gold ornaments. While Bromberg and Kilinski's work is only for comprehensive ancient art collections, Deppert-Lippitz's catalog is excellent for any collection on the history of jewelry, and the Pennsylvania catalog should prove an outstanding addition to collections surveying ancient Egyptian art or the history of its excavation.?Mary Morgan Smith, Northland P.L., Pittsburgh<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Venomous Snakes of the World</h2><p><p>Feared, revered, and often misunderstood, venomous snakes have been a source of legend and nightmare since time immemorial.

The faint of heart (or politically correct) should stay away. <i>The White Boy Shuffle</i> is a gleefully satiric gloss on black history and culture, featuring a main character named Gunnar (as in Myrdal) Kaufman, descendant of Euripides Kaufman, who stood aside and let Crispus Attucks get shot during the Boston Massacre, and Swen Kaufman, who--in an unfortunate reversal-- escaped south from freedom into slavery. Elsewhere, it features a character who attends Dred Scott High School, and another who works for the Department of Visual Segregation in Nashville, Tennessee, painting "Whites Only" and "Colored Only" signs.Winner of the 2016 Man Booker Prize<br>Winner of the 2015 National Book Critics Circle Award in Fiction<br>Named one of the best books of 2015 by The New York Times Book Review and the Wall Street Journal<br><br>Paul Beatty is the author of three novels&#x2015;Slumberland, Tuff, and The White Boy Shuffle&#x2015;and two books of poetry: Big Bank Take Little Bank and Joker, Joker, Deuce.

As a designer and manufacturer who emphasized careful workmanship, respect for natural materials, and simple lines, Stickley had a profound impact on the look of American homes. Today, Arts and Crafts design -- synonymous with Stickley to many people -- has become an American passion. <p> Elegantly designed and lushly photographed, <i>Stickley Style</i> is the first major publication to explore in full photographic color the central role Stickley played in the development of Arts and Crafts design. Author David Cathers invites us into the world of this influential furniture maker and provides us with an insider's tour of some of the country's most important Stickley collections and interiors. Here, imbued with pure and simple lines, are the comfortable Morris chairs, the upright settles, the solid oak chests, the hammered metalwork, and the delicate textiles that have come to epitomize Stickley's style. </p><p> But Stickley was more than a furniture maker -- he was a one-man phenomenon: book and magazine publisher, proponent of a simple and natural lifestyle, and de facto leader of the Arts and Crafts movement in America. Calling the composite of his ideas and activities "the craftsmanship of life," he used the word <i>Craftsman</i> to refer to his houses, his furniture, and his magazine. </p><p> <i>Stickley Style</i> captures the excitement and revolutionary zeal of these ideas and this era, a time when Victorian fussiness was being abandoned in the search for a modern way to live. The book opens with a vivid description of the Craftsman idea and describes Stickley's vision of ways to make a house conducive to a life of beauty and contentment. Cathers then goes on to show us the collections in a series of stunning Arts and Crafts homes, including Stickley's own family home in New Jersey. Finally, for those who want to furnish their own homes with appropriate reproductions, an extensive catalogue presents everything from Stickley tables and sideboards to tall case clocks and metal door latches. Throughout, specially commissioned photographs by Alexander Vertikoff show the overall harmony that will make the Stickley style as much a favorite for the new century as it was for the last.</p></p><p>The Arts &amp; Crafts movement first gained popularity in England in the late 1800s as people became distressed by spreading industrialization and factory goods produced inexpensively with flimsy construction and inferior wood. Seeing that the new system treated workers as machines, the movement sought to revive a craftsmanship of earlier times. In the United States, Gustav Stickley gathered together many of the movement's shared beliefs as he tried to, among other things, clear the clutter typically found in Victorian interiors and replace it with something simpler. The book begins tracing Stickley's life in 1876 when, at 18, he found his life's vocation while working in his uncle's furniture factory in Brandt, Pennsylvania. Through wonderful photos (many of them full-page) and careful wording, David Cathers and Alexander Vertikoff demonstrate a clear appreciation for Stickley's style--unvarnished wood, exposed joinery, strength, no-nonsense forms, and the beauty of integrity. Stickley, in short, devoted his life to celebrating and making visible the elements of construction. The work of others who helped to shape the Arts &amp; Crafts movement--including architect Harvey Ellis, Charles and Henry Greene, Elbert Hubbard's Roycroft community, and Charles Rohlf--is also examined. Among the highlights of the book is Craftsman Farms, an artisan colony, model farm, and school Stickley built on 650 acres, described in its time as "a log cabin idealized." The book also examines Stickley's Colonial Revival House in Syracuse, New York, which he turned into the first Craftsman residential interior after a fire damaged the house on Christmas Eve, 1901. It was also to be the house where Stickley, widowed and nearly penniless, lived out most of his final years (he died in 1942) with his daughter and her five children. Many of the details about Stickley's personal life come from his grandchildren's memories. "He was," one grandchild has written, "almost an evangelist in bringing new thoughts and new appreciation of things artistic and new social thinking. That is something that doesn't go bankrupt and he, as an inspiring person, never did go bankrupt." <i>--John Russell</i><b>David Cathers</b> is a writer and frequent lecturer on the Arts and Crafts movement.

Having been exposed to American comics at an early age, he spent decades honing his keen mind and his massive body in order to burn out this colonial cultural infection. One of the longest continuously publishing independent web-based cartoonists, John has plied his trade since the late nineties moving from Bobbins to Scary Go Round to Bad Machinery, developing the deeply weird world of Tackleford long after many of his fellow artists were ground into dust and bones by Time Itself. He has only once shed a single tear, but you only meet Sergio Aragon�s for the first time once. John resides in Letchworth Garden City, England, and is known to his fellow villagers only as He Who Has Conquered.BOOKLIST<b> -- </b>While Mildred struggles with her feelings for Lee, a bad boy she met in detention, Sonny is intrigued by the mysterious new girl in school, despite his reluctance to move fully into adolescence. Mildred's troubles are compounded by Lee's still-current girlfriend, from whom he is unable to break away, and by Mildred's friends, Lottie and Shauna, who are full of unhelpful advice. Meanwhile, the usual problems of school and family cause their own stresses for the teens. As in the other volumes of the popular webcomic series, Allison seamlessly blends realistic teenagers, full of both silliness and angst, and fantastic events, in this case, Sonny's crush, which has a strange connection to both a fur pelt Lottie found on the seashore and a weird, hairy man who has been seen in town. Allison's bright colors perfectly highlight his expressive art, with each character having his or her distinct personality. The result is a charmingly odd story that will appeal to both teens and adults.<br></p><h2>Comprehensive NCLEX-RN Review 17th edition</h2><p>Jotted down important notes during ATII live review from the speakers lecture</p><p></p><h2>Dead Lake</h2><p><b><i>Keep the door locked...</i></b><br><br>A week's visit to the remote Harob Lake cabin couldn't have come at a better time for Sam.<br><br>She's battling artist's block ahead of a major gallery exhibition.

At the close of the European theater, Gerecke received his most challenging �assignment: he was sent to Nuremberg to minister to the twenty-one imprisoned Nazi leaders awaiting trial for crimes against humanity. Detailed, incisive and emotionally charged, <em>Mission at Nuremberg</em> unearths groundbreaking new research and compelling first-hand accounts to take us deep inside the Nuremberg Palace of Justice, into the very cells of the accused, and the courtroom where they answered to the world for their crimes.

From the steel foundry to the burger-grill, from Woodrow Wilson to John Sweeney, from Homestead to Pittston, Lichtenstein weaves together a compelling matrix of ideas, stories, strikes, laws, and people in a streamlined narrative of work and labor in the twentieth century.</p><p>The "labor question" became a burning issue during the Progressive Era because its solution seemed essential to the survival of American democracy itself. Beginning there, Lichtenstein takes us all the way to the organizing fever of contemporary Los Angeles, where the labor movement stands at the center of the effort to transform millions of new immigrants into alert citizen unionists. He offers an expansive survey of labor's upsurge during the 1930s, when the New Deal put a white, male version of industrial democracy at the heart of U.S. political culture. He debunks the myth of a postwar "management-labor accord" by showing that there was (at most) a limited, unstable truce.</p><p>Lichtenstein argues that the ideas that had once sustained solidarity and citizenship in the world of work underwent a radical transformation when the rights-centered social movements of the 1960s and 1970s captured the nation's moral imagination. The labor movement was therefore tragically unprepared for the years of Reagan and Clinton: although technological change and a new era of global economics battered the unions, their real failure was one of ideas and political will. Throughout, Lichtenstein argues that labor's most important function, in theory if not always in practice, has been the vitalization of a democratic ethos, at work and in the larger society. To the extent that the unions fuse their purpose with that impulse, they can once again become central to the fate of the republic. <i>State of the Union</i> is an incisive history that tells the story of one of America's defining aspirations.</p></p><p>Does anyone still look for the union label? Apparently not, to gauge historian Nelson Lichtenstein's history of the rise, heyday, and long decline of labor unions in America.<p> In the Progressive era, Lichtenstein writes, the "labor question" lay at the heart of a whole complex of political ideas governing the social betterment of working people and the development of a more equitable society. These ideas flourished through the course of the early twentieth century, as unions attained more and more influence and as Keynesian notions of organized labor being "essential to boost mass purchasing power and thereby sustain economic growth" became established. After World War II, however, unionism began a slow collapse, helped along by the rise of conservative, antilabor politics. Although ideas of workplace justice and the extension of civil rights into the private sector remain strong, organized labor has not--with the result, Lichtenstein argues, that many American workers are worse off today than they were a quarter of a century ago. Lichtenstein's narrative capably summarizes trends in modern labor history, and it provides much fuel for activists seeking renewed labor-based politics. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><p>"Scholars have come to look to Nelson Lichtenstein for state-of-the-art work on American labor history. Now he has synthesized his immense learning into a powerful narrative of the ups and downs of unions since the New Deal. Elegiac, sympathetic, and keenly realistic, <i>State of the Union</i> focuses, above all, on the role of ideas and ideology in shaping contentious outcomes. The writing is engaged, analytically suggestive, and thoughtfully revisionist. Not just students of trade unions, but historians of the moments and episodes Lichtenstein chronicles, will be wrestling with this fascinating book for a long time to come."<b>--Ira Katznelson, Ruggles Professor of Political Science and History, Columbia University</b></p><p>"This is a brilliant work of historical synthesis and interpretation. No other historian has produced a narrative that cogently surveys intellectual developments, economic change, political and legal conflict, and the complexities of labor's internal struggles and weaves them into a compelling narrative that makes sense of the rise and fall of the working-class movement."<b>--Michael Kazin, Professor of History, Georgetown University</b></p><p>"Lichtenstein's textured account offers an impressive combination of astute historical analysis and keen social insight. Lichtenstein demonstrates how, despite its civil rights origins, the 'rights revolution' of the past generation has joined free-market ideology in undermining the legal and social basis for worker solidarity and union success. Greater individual freedoms have ironically not always helped the working people of America."<b>--David Abraham, Professor of Law, University of Miami Law School</b></p><p>"Nelson Lichtenstein, one of our leading historians, follows the movement for democracy and rights at work over the last hundred years, offering a masterful synthesis of the new labor history and the first comprehensive framework for a history of labor in our time."<b>--Dorothy Sue Cobble, Professor of Labor Studies, Rutgers University</b></p><p>"<i>State of the Union</i> is a uniquely important study of the labor movement in twentieth-century American politics. Lichtenstein demonstrates both an intricate, grounded knowledge of union dynamics and a finely nuanced, sophisticated understanding of American political history since the New Deal. This book is a must read for anyone seriously interested in making sense of American politics during the last three-quarters of a century."<b>--Adolph Reed, Professor of Political Science on the Graduate Faculty of Political and Social Science, New School University, and member of the Interim National Council of the Labor Party</b></p><p>"You can find no better guide to the past and present of the American labor movement than Nelson Lichtenstein. Aimed at a general audience, this book shows how the health of American democracy depends on vital working-class organizations. It examines why unions have flourished in the past and asks how they may do so again."<b>--William Forbath, Professor of Law and History, University of Texas, Austin, and author of<i>Law and the Shaping of the American Labor Movement</i></b></p><p>"Why has the labor movement's ability to speak collectively on behalf of American workers declined so dramatically? Ranging confidently across political, intellectual, social, and economic history, Nelson Lichtenstein gives us a sweeping and provocative analysis of the 'labor question' in the past fifty years--and how workers' basic democratic rights have been increasingly marginalized, contained, or eliminated. He eloquently reminds us that if we are to have democracy in America, we must celebrate, not repress, basic human rights at the workplace."<b>--Dana Frank, Professor of American Studies, University of California, Santa Cruz</b></p></p><h2>Hotel Vendome: A Novel</h2><p>Danielle Steel&#x2019;s dazzling new novel invites readers into the ultra-glamorous world of a five-star New York hotel, and brings to vivid life the man who builds it as his dream, the girl who grows up in its loving embrace, and the colorful guests and staff who make its magic complete. <br><b>&nbsp;</b><br><b>HOTEL VEND�ME</b><br>&nbsp;<br>The hotel was old, run-down.

The black-and-white-checked-marble floors were immaculate, red runners were rolled out the instant there was a drop of rain outside, the moldings on the walls were exquisite, and the enormous crystal chandelier that hung in the lobby was reminiscent of the finest palaces in Europe. The hotel was much smaller than the one that had inspired its decor, but for practiced travelers, it was remarkably similar to the Ritz in Paris, where the Hotel Vend�me's owner had worked as an assistant manager for two years, during his training in the finest hotels in Europe.<br><br>Hugues Martin was forty years old, a graduate of the illustrious and respected �cole H�teli�re de Lausanne in Switzerland, and the hotel on Manhattan's Upper East Side was his dream. He still couldn't believe how lucky he had been, how perfectly it had all come together five years before. His Swiss banker father and equally conservative mother had been devastated when he announced that he wanted to go to hotel school. He came from a family of bankers, and they thought that running a hotel, or working in one, had a seamy quality to it, of which they strongly disapproved. They had done everything they could to talk him out of it, to no avail. After four years at the school in Lausanne, he trained and eventually had respected positions at the Hotel du Cap in Cap d'Antibes, the Ritz in Paris, and Claridge's in London, and even did a brief stint at the famed Peninsula Hotel in Hong Kong. He figured out during that time that if he ever had his own hotel, he wanted it to be somewhere in the States.<br><br>Hugues worked at the Plaza in New York before it closed for extensive renovations, and he assumed that he was still light-years away from his dream. Then it happened. The Hotel Mulberry was put up for sale, a small tired hotel that had been run-down for years and had never been considered chic, despite its perfect location. When he heard about it, Hugues put together every penny of his savings, took out every loan he could get in both New York and Switzerland, and used all of the modest inheritance his parents had left him, which he had carefully put aside and invested. And the combination made the purchase of the hotel possible. He just managed to do it, with a mortgage on the building. And suddenly Hugues was able to buy the<br><br>Mulberry and do the necessary renovations, which took two years, and at the end of it the Hotel Vend�me was born, to the amazement of New Yorkers, most of whom said they had never even realized that there was a hotel in that location.<br><br>The building had been a small private hospital in the 1920s and was turned into a hotel in the 1940s, with abysmally bad decor. In contrast, in its transformed state, every inch of the Vend�me was magnificent, and the service was superb. Hugues had brought chefs from all over the world for their now extremely popular restaurant. His catering manager was one of the best in the business, and everyone agreed that even the food from room service was fantastic. In its first year it had become an overnight success and was booked months in advance now, with reservations made by visitors to the city from around the world. The presidential suite was one of the finest in the city. The Hotel Vend�me was an absolute gem, with beautifully decorated suites, and rooms with fireplaces, moldings, and high ceilings. The hotel faced south, so most of the rooms were sunny, and Hugues had chosen the finest china, crystal, and linens, and as many antiques as he could afford, like the chandelier in the lobby, which he had bought in Geneva at a Christie's auction. It had come out of a French ch�teau near Bordeaux and was in perfect condition.<br><br>Hugues ran his 120-room hotel with Swiss precision, a warm smile, and an iron hand. His employees were discreet and experienced, had a remarkable memory for every guest, and kept detailed files on each important client's needs and requests while they were there. It had made the Vend�me the most popular small hotel in New York for the past three years. And the moment one entered the lobby, one knew it was a special place. A young bellboy stood at the revolving door, in a uniform inspired by those the chasseurs wore at the Ritz: navy pants, a short jacket, a small amount of gold braid on the collar, and a little round hat with a strap under the chin, tilted at an angle. To meet the clients' needs, there was a fleet of willing bellmen, a crew of brilliantly capable concierges. Everyone moved rapidly to serve the guests, and the entire staff was ready to service large requests and small ones. Hugues knew that impeccable service was<br><br>essential.<br><br>The assistant managers wore black tailcoats and striped trousers, once again inspired by the Ritz. And Hugues himself was on hand night and day, in a dark blue suit, always with a white shirt and dark Herm�s tie, and he had an extraordinary memory for everyone who had stayed with them and, whenever possible, greeted important guests himself. He was the consummate hotel owner, and no detail missed his practiced eye. And he expected his department heads to meet the standards that he set. Guests of the hotel came as much for the service as the luxurious decor.<br><br>As an added touch, the hotel was always filled with spectacular flowers, and its spa was one of the best. There was almost no service the staff wouldn't provide, as long as it was legal and in relatively good taste. And despite the objections Hugues knew his parents had had, he couldn't help feeling that they would have been proud of him now. He had used their money well, and the hotel had been such a success in its first three years that he was almost out of debt. It wasn't surprising, since Hugues worked day and night himself to make it what it was. And personally, his victory had come at a high price. Owning the hotel had cost him his wife. It had been the subject of considerable gossip among staff and guests.<br><br>Nine years before, when Hugues had been working at Claridge's in London, he had met Miriam Vale, the internationally famous and spectacularly beautiful supermodel. And like everyone else who laid eyes on her, he had been dazzled by her the moment they met. He had been infinitely proper and professional, as he had always been with guests of the hotels he worked in, but she was a twenty-three-year-old girl, and she had made it clear that she wanted him, and he fell head over heels in love with her overnight. She was American, and eventually he had followed her back to New York. It had been an exciting time for him, and he took a lesser position at the Plaza to be in the same city with her and continue their romance. And much to his own amazement, she was just as much in love with him, and they were married within six months. He had never been happier in his life than in their early years together.<br><br>Eighteen months later their daughter Heloise was born, and Hugues was madly in love with his wife and child. He trembled when he said it, for fear of angering the gods, but he always said then that he had the perfect life. And he was a dedicated man. Despite whatever temptations came his way in the hotel business, he was totally in love with and faithful to his wife. She continued her modeling career after Heloise was born, and everyone at the Plaza had fawned over his little girl and indulged her, and teased them about her name. Hugues assured them honestly that she had been named after his great-grandmother and he didn't expect to stay at the Plaza forever, so there was no reason not to use the name. Heloise was two years old when he bought the Mulberry and turned it into the Vend�me. He had everything he wanted then, a wife and child he loved, and his own hotel. Miriam had been far less enthused about the project and had complained bitterly that it would take too much of his time, but owning his own hotel, and one of the sort he was creating, had always been his dream.<br><br>His parents had been even less pleased about Miriam than they had been about his working in the hotel business. They had serious doubts that a spoiled, twenty-three-year-old, spectacularly beautiful, internationally known supermodel would make him a good wife. But Hugues loved her profoundly and had no doubts.<br><br>As Hugues had expected, it took two years to renovate the hotel. It came in only slightly over budget, and the end result was everything he had hoped.<br><br>He and Miriam had been married for six years, and Heloise was four, when the Hotel Vend�me opened, and Miriam had obligingly posed for some of their ads. It added a distinctive cachet that the owner was married to Miriam Vale, and male guests in particular always hoped they'd catch a glimpse of her in the lobby or at the bar. What they saw far more frequently than her mother was four-year-old Heloise following after her father, with one of the maids holding her hand, and she enchanted everyone she met. She had gone from being Heloise at the Plaza to being Heloise at the Vend�me, and became something of a mascot for the hotel, and was clearly the pride and joy of her father's life.<br><br>Greg Bones, the famous and notoriously badly behaved rock star, was one of the first guests in one of the penthouse suites, and fell in love with the hotel. Hugues was uneasy about it, because Bones was well known for trashing hotel rooms and causing chaos wherever he stayed, but he behaved surprisingly well at the Vend�me, much to Hugues's relief. And they were fully prepared to meet celebrity needs and requests.<br><br>On Greg's second day there, he met Miriam Vale Martin at the bar, surrounded by assistants, magazine editors, stylists, and a famous photographer after a shoot. They had just finished a twelve-page spread for Vogue that afternoon, and as soon as they recognized Greg Bones, they invited him to join them. And what happened afterward hadn't taken long. Miriam spent most of the following night in Greg's suite with him, while Hugues thought she was out when he was working. The maids were all aware of where she was and what had happened-the room service waiters discovered it when Greg ordered champagne and caviar for them at midnight. And it rapidly became the backstairs talk of the hotel and spread like a forest fire. By the end of the week Hugues had heard about it too. He didn't know whether to confront her or to hope it would pass.<br><br>Hugues, Miriam, and Heloise had their own private apartment one floor below the two penthouse suites, and the hotel security were well aware that Miriam was constantly slipping up the back stairs to join Greg in his suite, whenever Hugues was in his office. It was an extremely awkward situation for Hugues, who didn't want to ask the famous rock star to leave the hotel. It would cause a public scandal. Instead he begged his wife to come to her senses and behave. He suggested she go away for a few days, to stop the madness of what she was doing. But when Bones checked out, she flew to Los Angeles with him on his private plane. She left Heloise with Hugues and promised she'd be back in a few weeks, and said this was something she had to get out of her system, and begged him to understand. It was a heartbreak and humiliation for Hugues, but he didn't want to lose his wife. He hoped that if he let her do it, she'd get over her infatuation quickly. She was twenty-nine years old, and he thought she'd come to her senses. He loved her, and they had a child. But it was all over the tabloids by then, and on Page 6 of the New York Post. It was a crushing humiliation for Hugues, in front of all of his employees and an entire city.<br><br>Hugues told Heloise that her mother had to go away to work, which was something that the little girl already understood at four. The story became harder to maintain when Miriam didn't come home. And three months later, back in London with Greg Bones, Miriam told him she was filing for divorce. It had been the most devastating moment of his life, and although his demeanor with the guests was unchanged, and he was ever smiling and attentive to them, in the three years since, those who knew him well were aware that he had never been the same again. He was far more aloof, serious, deeply hurt, and withdrawn in his private moments, although he put a good face on it for his staff and guests.<br><br>Hugues had been the soul of discretion since the divorce. His assistant and some of his department heads were aware of quiet affairs he had had, occasionally with hotel guests or with well-bred or accomplished women around the city. He was one of the most sought- after bachelors in New York, invited to everything, although he rarely accepted. He preferred to keep a low profile, and keep his personal life to himself. And most of the time he was working at the hotel. The hotel came before all else for him, except for his daughter, who came first. He hadn't had a serious relationship since Miriam left and didn't want one. He believed that to run a hotel properly, you had to sacrifice your own life. He was always there, keeping an eye on everything, and working incredible hours, most of the time behind the scenes to ensure the smooth running of the hotel.<br><br>A month after her divorce from Hugues was final, Miriam married Greg Bones, and they had been married now for two years and had just had a baby girl six months before. Heloise had only seen her mother a few times since she left. Heloise was sad about it. And Hugues was angry at Miriam. She was too busy in her new life, too obsessed with Greg, and now their child, to tend to their daughter or even see her. Heloise and Hugues had become relics of her past. It left Hugues no other choice but to be both mother and father to their child. He never commented on it to Heloise, but he considered it a painful circumstance for them both.</p><h2>30-Minute Get Real Meals</h2><p>No pasta? No dessert? No way!

Political and passionate, this bilingual picture book about the L.A. janitors' strike in 2000 gives a voice to contemporary urban Latino working-class families. With the English text at the top of each page and the Spanish translation below, the story is told in the first person by Carlitos, a Mexican immigrant child, whose widowed mother cleans offices nights and weekends but still can't manage to support her family. After Mama tells Carlitos that she is helping to organize a janitors' strike for a union, Carlitos gets support at school from his teacher and classmates, and he joins the march with a sign that reads: "I love my Mama. She is a janitor!" Delgado's bright, active pastel pictures, much like poster art, are reminiscent of the work of Mexican artist Orozco, with pulsing scenes of marching crowds in the streets as well as warm close-ups of people at work and home. Carlitos' story is framed by lots of politics for group discussion, and the inside of the dust jacket is a poster with art and text about labor history. <i>Hazel Rochman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Yu draws on recently released classified materials from the U.S. National Archives and on previously unopened Chinese documents to reveal the immense and complex challenges the agency and its director, General William Donovan, confronted in China.</p><p>A significant account of the wartime exploits in China of the OSS (Office of Strategic Services), the intelligence agency that was later to become the CIA. Yu's (History/US Naval Academy) is the first history based on original US archives and on recently published articles and memoirs in China. The fighting among the 20 US bureaucratic agencies and dozen independent intelligence organizations in Chungking seems to have exceeded in intensity anything they were able to mobilize against the Japanese, at least until the last months of the war. The main contenders were the US army commanders Stilwell and later Wedemeyer; Tai Li, the head of Chinese intelligence; Milton Miles, the head of naval intelligence; William Donovan, chosen by Roosevelt to set up the OSS; the crusty American ambassador Gauss; and a swirling, ever-changing group of contending individuals and agencies seeking to push themselves and sabotage everyone else. These included--though for a long time the US participants seemed oblivious to it--both the British, who didn't want China to be too strong after the war, and the Communists, who wanted to undermine the Nationalist government, get weapons and money from the US, and build up a reputation as the main enemy of the Japanese at the very time that they were engaged in making deals with them. The main winners were the OSS, which seems to have emerged largely unscathed almost in spite of itself; and the Communists, whose shrewd infiltration of the British, the French, and above all the Nationalists was truly remarkable. On the critical question of the extent to which the Communists infiltrated the Americans, Yu is circumspect. He describes, for example, the extraordinary assistance given them by a second-ranking State Department employee like John Paton Davies without analyzing his motives. It is one of the few deficiencies in an important if profoundly depressing story of bureaucratic infighting, jealousies, incomprehension, and ultimate failure. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Yu (history, U.S. Naval Academy) has based his work on recently declassified materials at the National Archives in Washington, D.C. He presents a fascinating story of the intelligence activities of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) in China during World War II. (The OSS was the precursor of the CIA.) First, Yu examines President Roosevelt's decision to dispatch emissaries to England, China, and the war-torn Mediterranean area in 1941. Then he depicts how OSS/China director General William Donovan used Koreans as surrogates in China to build an intelligence empire. He explores the intricate espionage among the Americans, the British, the Chinese Nationalists, and the Chinese and Soviet Communists. Finally, Yu probes deeply into the demise of the OSS and the creation of the CIA. This is an expertly structured, exhaustively researched book.

I firmly believe that there is, and it is my purpose in this, first complete exposition of the subject, to attempt to explain it so that you may use it if you desire.</p><p>About fifteen years ago the financial editor of a great Los Angeles newspaper, after attending lectures I had given to financial men in that city and after having read my brochure, <i>T.N.T.&#x2014;It Rocks the Earth,</i> wrote:</p><p>&#x201c;You have caught from the ether something that has a mystical quality&#x2014;a something that explains the magic of coincidence, the mystery of what makes men lucky.&#x201d;</p><p>I realized that I had run across something that was workable, but I didn&#x2019;t consider it then, neither do I now, as anything mystical, except in the sense that it is unknown to the majority of people. It is something that has always been known to a fortunate few down the centuries, but, for some unknown reason, is little understood by the average person.</p><p>When I started out years ago to teach this science through the medium of lectures and my brochure, I wasn&#x2019;t certain that it could be or would be grasped by the ordinary individual; but now that I have seen those who have used it double and triple their incomes, build their own successful businesses, acquire homes in the country, and create sizable fortunes, I am convinced that any intelligent person who is sincere with himself can reach any heights he desires. I had no intention of writing a second book, although many urged me to do so, until a few months ago, when a woman in the book business, who had sold many copies of my first little book, literally &#x201c;read the riot act&#x201d; to me, declaring:</p><p>&#x201c;You have a duty to perform to the ex-service men and women, and all others who seek places for themselves in a postwar world, to give them in easily understood form not only what you contained in your <i>T.N.T.</i>&#x2014;<i>It Rocks the Earth</i> but the new material that you have given in your lectures. Everyone of ambition wants to get ahead and you have amply demonstrated you have something that will help anyone, and it&#x2019;s up to you to pass it along.&#x201d;</p><p>It took time to sell myself on the idea, but having served as a soldier in World War I, mostly in France and Germany, and having been an active official for many years in ex-service men&#x2019;s organizations as well as a member of a state commission to aid in the rehabilitation of ex-service men and women, I realized that it would be no easy task for many individuals to make outstanding places for themselves in a practical world from which they had long been separated. It is with them in mind, as well as all ambitious men and women, and with a sincere desire to help, that I write this full and detailed exposition of the power of belief.</p><p>I am cognizant of the fact that there are powerful forces at work in this country that would dominate us, substituting a kind of regimentation for the competitive system which has made America great among nations. They would attempt to destroy individual thinking and initiative, cherished ever since our Pilgrim Fathers established this country in defiance of Old World tyranny. I believe that we must continue to retain the wealth of spirit of our forefathers, for if we don&#x2019;t we shall find ourselves dominated in everything we do by a mighty few and shall become serfs in fact if not in name. Thus this work is written also to help develop individual thinking and doing.</p><p>Since I am aware that this book may fall into the hands of some who may call me a &#x201c;crackpot&#x201d; or a &#x201c;screwball,&#x201d; let me say that I am past the half-century mark and have had many years of hard practical business experience, as well as a goodly number of years as a newspaper man. I started as a police reporter, and police reporters are trained to get facts and &#x201c;accept nothing for granted.&#x201d; For a two-year period I was church editor of a large metropolitan newspaper, during which I came in close contact with clergymen and leaders of all sects and denominations, mind-healers, divine healers, Spiritualists, Christian Scientists, New Thought-ers, Unity leaders, sun and idol worshipers, and, yes, even a few infidels and pagans.</p><p>Gypsy Smith, well-known English evangelist, was making an early tour of America at that time, and as I used to sit night after night on his platform, watching people stumble down the aisles, some sobbing, others shouting hysterically, I wondered.</p><p>Again I wondered as I accompanied the police in answering a riot call when some Holy Rollers in a moment of hysteria knocked over a stove and set fire to their meeting hall. When I attended my first and only meeting of Shakers, I wondered as I did while attending various spiritualistic meetings. I wondered as I heard the testimonials at the Wednesday night meetings of Christian Scientists. I wondered when I witnessed a group of white people being immersed in the icy waters of a mountain stream and coming up shouting &#x201c;Hallelujah,&#x201d; even though their teeth were chattering. I wondered at the ceremonial dances of the Indians and their rain-calling programs. Billy Sunday also caused me to wonder, as in later years did Aimee Semple McPherson.</p><p>In France during the first war I marveled at the simple faith of the peasants and the powers of their village padres. The stories of the so-called miracles at Lourdes, as well as of somewhat similar miracles at other shrines, also held great interest. When I saw elderly men and women in a famous old Roman church climb literally on their knees up a long flight of stairs to gaze upon a holy urn&#x2014;a climb that is no simple task for an athletically trained young person&#x2014;I wondered again.</p><p>Business brought me into contact with the Mormons, and when I heard of the belief in the story of Joseph Smith and the revelations on the plates of gold, I was again given to wonderment. The Dukhobors of western Canada, who would doff their clothes when provoked, likewise made me wonder. While in Hawaii I heard much about the powers of the kahunas who, it was claimed, could, by praying, cause people to die or live. The great powers attributed to these kahunas profoundly impressed me.</p><p>In my early days as a newspaper man I saw a famous medium try to make the &#x201c;spirits&#x201d; respond before a crowded courtroom of antagonistic scoffers. The judge had promised the medium he would be freed if he could get the &#x201c;spirits&#x201d; to speak in the courtroom. They failed to materialize and I wondered why, because the medium&#x2019;s followers had testified to remarkable prior s�ances.</p><p>Many years later I was commissioned to write a series of articles on what is known in police parlance as the &#x201c;fortune-telling racket.&#x201d; I visited everything from gypsy phrenologists to crystal-ball gazers, from astrologers to spiritualistic mediums. I have heard what purported to be the voices of old Indian &#x201c;guides&#x201d; tell me the past, the present, and the future, and I heard from relatives I never knew existed.</p><p>Several times I have been in a hospital room in which people around me died, while others with seemingly no worse ailments were up and apparently fully recovered within a short time. I have known partially paralyzed people who claim they have cured their rheumatism or arthritis by wearing a copper band around their wrists&#x2014;and have known others who claimed a cure by mental healing. From relatives and close friends I have heard stories of how warts on hands have suddenly disappeared. I am familiar with the stories of those who permit rattlesnakes to bite them and still live, and with hundreds of other tales of mysterious healings and happenings.</p><p>I have, moreover, made myself familiar with the lives of great men and women of history; I have met and interviewed many outstanding men and women in all lines of human endeavor; and I have often wondered just what it was that took them to the top while others were lost in obscurity. I have seen coaches take apparently inferior baseball and football teams and infuse them with &#x201c;something&#x201d; that caused them to win. In the depression days I saw sales organizations, badly whipped, do an abrupt about-face and bring in more business than ever before.</p><p>Apparently I was born with a huge bump of curiosity, for I have always had an insatiable yearning to seek explanations and answers. This yearning has taken me to many strange places, brought to light many peculiar cases, and has caused me to read every book I could get my hands on dealing with religions, cults, and both physical and mental sciences. I have read literally thousands of books on modern psychology, metaphysics, ancient magic, Voodooism, Yogism, Theosophy, Christian Science, Unity, Truth, New Thought, Cou�ism, and many others dealing with what I call &#x201c;Mind Stuff,&#x201d; as well as the philosophies and teachings of the great masters of the past.</p><p>Many were nonsensical, others strange, and many very profound. Gradually I discovered that there is a golden thread that runs through all the teachings and makes them work for those who sincerely accept and apply them, and that thread can be named in the single word&#x2014;<i>belief.</i> It is this same element or factor, belief, which causes people to be cured through mental healing, enables others to climb high the ladder of success, and gets phenomenal results for all who accept it. Why belief is a miracle worker is something that cannot be satisfactorily explained; but have no doubt about it, there&#x2019;s genuine magic in believing. &#x201c;The magic of believing&#x201d; became a phrase around which my thoughts steadily revolved.</p><p>I am convinced that in the so-called secret fraternal organizations there is a real &#x201c;royal secret&#x201d; which very few members ever grasp, and the conclusion must be that &#x201c;no mind ever receives the truth until it is prepared to receive it.&#x201d; I am convinced also that some of these organizations, like many secret orders which have a knowledge and an understanding of life, use parables and misinterpretations to mislead. In one order, candidates are provided with a very profound book (to be studied in connection with the degree work), which itself would be well-nigh an open-sesame to life if these candidates would understand and follow its tenets; but few read it, complaining that &#x201c;it is too deep&#x201d; for them.</p><p>When <i>T.N.T.&#x2014;It Rocks the Earth</i> was first published, I imagined that it would be easily understood, as I had written it simply; but as the years went by I found that some readers protested that it was too much in digest form, while others said they couldn&#x2019;t understand it. I had assumed that most people knew something about the power of thought. I was mistaken, and I realized that those who had an understanding of the subject were comparatively few. Later in my many years of lecturing before clubs, business and sales organizations, I discovered that while most people were vitally interested in the subject, it had to be fully explained. Finally, I undertook to write this book in words that anyone who reads can understand and with the hope that it will help many to reach their goal in life.</p><p>The science of thought is as old as man himself. The wise men of all ages have known about it and used it. The only thing the writer has done is to put the subject in modern language and bring to the reader&#x2019;s attention what a few of the outstanding minds of today are doing to substantiate the great truths that have come down through the centuries.</p><p>Fortunately for the world, people generally are coming to the realization that there is &#x201c;something to this mind-stuff after all,&#x201d; and the writer believes that there are millions of people who would like to get a better understanding of it and prove that it does work.</p><p>Therefore, I start with relating a few experiences of my own life, with the hope that by hearing them, you will gain a better understanding of the entire science. Early in 1918 I landed in France as a &#x201c;casual&#x201d; soldier, unattached to a regular company. As a result it was several weeks before my service record, necessary for my pay, caught up with me. During that period I was without money to buy gum, candy, cigarettes, and ...</p></p><h2>More Than Numbers: The Ways Churches Grow</h2><p>Mead explores what church growth and evangelism really mean in a time when it is mathematically impossible for every congregation to achieve significant numerical growth.

He lives in New London, New Hampshire.A companion to Strega Nona: Her Story, dePaola's breezy bio of Strega Nona's bumbling sidekick, Big Anthony, can be thoroughly enjoyed by readers whether they are new to the series or longtime fans. The tale opens with the christening of the newborn Anthony, identifiable even in infancy by his wild shock of yellow hair. On this occasion he spills holy water all over himself and everyone else within splashing distance?an omen of many misadventures to come. With an Amelia Bedelia-like innocence and tendency to heed only parts of directions, the boy triggers comic confusion wherever he goes. The buoyant art shows what the text does not tell: Anthony slipping under the table at his first birthday to topple an elegant cake onto his head; Anthony stacking not only books (as his teacher has directed) but all the classroom furniture on a groaning shelf; Anthony letting all the sheep out of their pens after listening to only the two final words of his mother's request, "don't leave any of the gates open." Readers will find even more to chuckle over after Big Anthony leaves home to earn his fortune ("Before he ruins ours," quips his grandmother). After several ill-fated job experiences in Italy's major cities, the well-intentioned fellow reads a want ad that leads him to Strega Nona's door and leaves readers at the same time and location as did the last page of Her Story. Though it's a delightful place to be, kids will likely flip back to the start, to relive bumbling Big Anthony's early life all over again.

Lawrence describes the famous guerrilla raids, and train bombings you know from the movie, but also tells of the Arab people and politics with great penetration.

The writing of Polish history, like Poland itself, has frequently fallen prey to interested parties. Professor Norman Davies adopts a sceptical stance towards all existing interpretations and attempts to bring a strong dose of common sense to his theme. He consequently presents a comprehensive survey of this frequently maligned and usually misunderstood country.</p><p>The most comprehensive survey of Polish history available in English, <i>God's Playground</i> demonstrates Poland's importance in European history from medieval times to the present.Norman Davies is chair of the history department, School of Slavonic and East European Studies, at the University of London.</p><h2>The Action of Subtraction</h2><p>Kindergarten-Grade 4-The author has used the format of his popular Words Are CATegorical books (Millbrook) to look at mathematical functions.

Rejecting traditional left dogma, and proudly affirming the influence of Bugs Bunny and the Incredible Hulk, these playful rebels against work expanded the critique of Capital into a critique of daily life and developed a truly radical theory and practice, rooted in poetry, provocation, blues, jazz and the pleasure principle. Active in strikes, free-speech fights and other tumults, they also introduced countless readers to important writings by and about surrealists, situationists, IWWs, anarchists, libertarian Marxists, Provos, the Japanese Zengakuren, and other political/cultural revolutionary-minded individuals and movements from all over the world.

For many dedicated bodybuilders, the weight-lifting theories of Arthur Jones are gospel. It was Jones, the inventor of Nautilus exercise equipment, who first discovered that short, intense workouts could produce better results than the long, high-volume workouts then in vogue. Even though research into Jones&#39;s methods has proved them correct, a number of high-profile strength coaches use HIT to train their athletes, and the bodybuilding magazine Ironman does HIT-based features every issue, there still are no major HIT books in stores. This new book-by champion bodybuilder, exercise researcher, and best-selling author Ellington Darden, who is a Jones disciple and friend-shows lifters how to apply the master&#39;s teachings, along with some new HIT concepts to achieve extraordinary results. At the heart of the book is a complete, illustrated, six-month course for explosive growth. Exercise by exercise, workout by workout, the reader is shown precisely what to do, and perhaps even more important, what not to do. Charging that too many bodybuilders follow a more-is-better approach-too many exercises, too many sets, and too much frequency-and rely on steroids to compensate for depleted recovery ability, Darden shows why HIT, steroid-free and healthy, is the best way to safely build muscle. Finally, the exercise religion Arthur Jones founded, and Darden fine-tuned, has its bible.

Licklider and the Revolution That Made Computing Personal</h2><p>A study of the evolution of the modern computer profiles the work of MIT psychologist J. C. R. Licklider, whose visionary dream of a &#34;human-computer symbiosis&#34; transformed the course of modern science and led to the development of the personal computer. Reprint.</p><p>While it's true that no one person's vision encompassed all of what we now consider personal computing, we can't help but focus on individual effort as we try to understand how we got here. Science writer M. Mitchell Waldrop carefully balances this hero culture with a historian's mania for completeness in <i>The Dream Machine: J.C.R. Licklider and the Revolution That Made Computing Personal</i>.<p>"Lick," as his students and colleagues called him, was deeply involved in guiding the evolution of personal and networked computing from the 1950s through the 1980s, after leaving a career in cognitive psychology. Waldrop captures his spirit vividly--contrary to our stereotypical view of computer scientists, Licklider was profoundly interested in his fellow humans, and this interest helped him lead the design of technology adapted to human needs.</p><p>Waldrop interviewed dozens of contemporaries and examined reams of notes and primary sources to compose this massive biography of influence that stretches from MIT to the Pentagon to Xerox PARC and far beyond. If it sometimes seems that Licklider was a little too well beloved, especially in comparison to some of the more colorful figures in computing's recent history, it is worth remembering that his patience and humility were the very qualities that helped deliver the home-computing revolution we take for granted today. If we had to choose just one 20th-century computer pioneer that we couldn't do without, it would have to be the man behind the Dream Machine. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>M.

Throughout the state, association members gathered heirloom quilts from families and from major collections. Of more than 1700 quilts examined, 140 were chosen for full-color photographs to represent the very best from the state. </p><p>Co-published with the Association, <i>Mississippi Quilts</i> is a thorough examination of the state's quilting heritage before 1946, when synthetic fabrics and batting became widely available. The featured quilts, created from the early 1800s to 1946, are joined by archival black-and-white illustrations of selected quilt makers and by historical photos by Eudora Welty. </p><p>From the beginning of the project, Welty, a Mississippi writer and photographer, a Pulitzer Prize winner, and a member of the Mississippi Quilt Association, served as Honorary Chair. <i>Mississippi Quilts</i> features five of Welty's photographs as chapter dividers, along with quilt-related quotations from her work. </p><p>Most of the quilts featured are handmade.

Quilts from such prominently known makers as Hystercine Rankin and Martha Skelton are handsomely presented alongside group works by family artisans of superb skill. </p><p>The book contains 152 color photographs of Mississippi quilts and photographs of a number of quilt makers. Exemplified is a wide range of quilts, from exquisite broderie perse to humble string quilts pieced on paper and made from an assortment of scrap fabric, including feed sacks.

Also pictured are more unusual patterns such as original applique designs, rare Target quilts, and crazy quilts depicting events from the makers' lives. </p><p>Intended to heighten awareness of the rich culture of quilting, this book is a combination of history and aesthetic analysis of the art in the Magnolia State. The book explores the role of quilting in Mississippi's cultural history, showing not only how these quilts are testimonies to artistry and ingenuity, but also how they are significant to the families and communities in which they were created. Also, Mary Elizabeth Johnson, author of many books on quilting, discusses the similarities and differences among quilts from different cultural traditions. </p><p>Finally, <i>Mississippi Quilts</i> features a bonus chapter that showcases current quilters who are continuing and expanding on the practice of one of the state's finest folk art traditions. </p><p>Mary Elizabeth Johnson is a publishing consultant, freelance writer, and editor.

Association members examined more than 1700 quilts from public and private collections, finally choosing 140 quilts created between the early 1800s and 1946, after which synthetic fabrics and battings became available. Johnson (The America Quilt) describes the quilts within the social and cultural traditions of Mississippi and offers detailed discussions on the pattern, maker, date, current owner, and dimensions. Often a photograph of the quilt maker is included. Chapters detail the wide range of styles represented in Mississippi quilt-making traditions in various time periods, from 1826 through the Civil War and Reconstruction periods and into the 20th century, with a chapter on the continuation of the tradition today.

To counter it, Constantine puts out a televised call for happy people, and the fate of humankind depends on the outcome of a soccer match. Crime-novelist Mina provides a stronger plotline than this series usually sees, and she nails the characterizations of Constantine and his established supporting cast. Manco&#39;s dark, moody art serves her well. Flagg, Gordon</p><h2>The Hearing (Dismas Hardy)</h2><p>When a homicide detective&#39;s daughter is killed, the aggrieved father pushes the main suspect--a homeless heroin addict discovered at the scene--for answers, ambitious D.A. Sharron Pratt sets out to revive her troubled administration by declaring war on the accused, and defense attorney Dismas Hardy faces an uphill battle to ensure a fair trial. 125,000 first printing.</p><p>When the police find Cole Burgess crouched over Elaine Wager's body on a deserted San Francisco street, they don't have to look very far for means, motive, and the assumption of guilt. The heroin junkie is carrying the gun that killed the rising political star, he has her jewelry and wallet in his pockets, and he flees as fast as his smacked- out legs will take him--right into a fire hydrant. But homicide lieutenant Abe Glitsky isn't willing to leave anything to chance. Elaine was his daughter, though neither had ever acknowledged the relationship. Desperate to avenge his daughter's murder, the policeman (whose razor-sharp profile mirrors an even edgier personality) encourages his detectives to "sweat" the suspect for a confession. <p> The DA is equally eager to capitalize (pun intended) on the murder: bent on reversing her public image as being soft on crime, Sharron Pratt declares that her office will seek the death penalty. Enter Dismas Hardy, author John Lescroart's smooth-talking Irish lawyer, cajoled into defending Burgess. He doesn't like his client, but he doesn't trust the confession nor Pratt's sudden blood thirst. Joining investigative forces with Elaine's paralegal, Treya Ghent, and Glitsky himself suspended after news of the confession leaks out, Hardy will find himself on the trail of corruption and deceit in the most rarefied of legal circles. </p><p> <i>The Hearing</i> is a big, burly legal thriller, and its size is both vice and virtue. Lescroart handles his courtroom scenes with a deft touch, but his <i>ex judicia</i> narrative is often ponderous. He tends to introduce plot developments with sweeping statements, bolstering them with clumsy retrospection, and his characterization leaves something to be desired: "the very cute Amy Wu" has "large enough breasts so that people rarely noticed the bit of thickness at her waist"; and "Visser had a couple of character flaws that were going to negatively impact his aspirations on the force." These cavils aside, <i>The Hearing</i> will doubtlessly appeal to Grisham and Turow fans-- and to Lescroart's own considerable retinue. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p>John Lescroart is the bestselling author of eleven previous novels, including <i>Nothing but the Truth</i>, <i>the Mercy Rule</i>, <i>Guilt</i>, and <i>The 13th Juror</i>.</p><h2>Artistry in Clay: Contemporary Pottery of the Southwest</h2><p>Examines the pottery techniques and designs used by contemporary Indians in the Southwestern States and discusses the work of individual Indian potters</p><p></p><h2>Becoming (The Daughters of the Moon #12)</h2><p>Lately Tianna has been feeling unsettled and she can&#39;t understand why.

In dozens of poems and a series of fascinating conversations with poets of all stripes gathered for the acclaimed Geraldine R. Dodge Poetry Festival, <em>Fooling with Words</em> brings poetry to life for the reader. <p>Bill Moyers has been covering the poetry beat for more than a decade, and in the fall of 1998 he returned to the Dodge Festival with his public television cameras, capturing the performances of the poets, and, in interviews with them, their dazzling array of images, metaphors, and emotions. Coleman Barks not only reads from his translations of Rumi, but also shares the poems that he wrote in tribute to his "most beautiful granddaughter." Mark Doty talks with Moyers about "poetry's great power to preserve, its ability to take a moment in time and hold it forever." Jane Hirshfield talks about the influence on her poetry of the eight years she studied Zen, including three years in a monastery when she didn't write at all. </p><p>Moyers listens to these and other poets including Lorna Dee Cervantes, Deborah Garrison, Paul Muldoon, Marge Piercy, Kurtis Lamkin, Shirley Geok-lin Lim, Stanley Kunitz, and Poet Laureate Robert Pinsky, and weaves another invaluable and enjoyable tapestry of poems with the memorable voices of the poets themselves. Anyone who loves poetry or is seeking a special gift will cherish <em>Fooling with Words.</em></p></p><p>The biennial Geraldine R. Dodge Poetry Festival in Waterloo, New Jersey, has been called the Woodstock of poetry. Taking place over the course of several (often hot and sticky) summer days, the festival comprises readings and workshops and performances. Audiences under the big top can reach a couple thousand. It is stunning to see so many lovers of poetry gathered in one place.<p> For <i>Fooling with Words</i>, Moyers interviews 11 of the poets on the festival's 1998 roster. "Talking to poets about their lives," he says, "makes their poetry more accessible to me." And what a variety of poets and lives he has come up with! The youngest is New Yorker senior editor Deborah Garrison (<i>A Working Girl Can't Win</i>), then 32; the eldest, Stanley Kunitz, 93 years old and wearing a lime-green jacket. In between are Coleman Barks, Robert Pinsky, Lorna Dee Cervantes, Paul Muldoon, Marge Piercy, Mark Doty, Jane Hirshfield, Kurtis Lamkin, and Shirley Geok-Lin Lim. These conversations are dotted with poems. "I like to know about the experiences that produced the poet," says Moyers, and the intermingling of conversation and poetry is a wonderful, casual way to be introduced to a poet's sensibility. Doty discusses the pain of "writing about the hardest things in the world." Hirshfield talks about her Zen practice and the notion that ideas "can graze inside us like animals who reshape the landscape with their grazing." Throughout, there is the sense of lives that would not be bearable without poetry. "Poetry is what has saved me," says one poet here; "You never know when your poem will come to someone's rescue," chimes another. <i>--Jane Steinberg</i></p>Bill Moyers's career as a television journalist has earned him more than thirty Emmy Awards.

He attended the University of Nebraska and served in the United States Army during the Spanish-American War. A successful businessman, he founded the Clason Map Company of Denver, Colorado and published the first road atlas of the United States and Canada. In 1926, he issued the first of a famous series of pamphlets on thrift and financial success, using parables set in ancient Babylon to make each of his points. These were distributed in large quantities by banks and insurance companies and became familiar to millions, the most famous being &#x201c;The Richest Man in Babylon,&#x201d; the parable from which the present volume takes its title. These &#x201c;Babylonian parables&#x201d; have become a modern inspirational classic.Originally published in 1926, sprinkled with King James English, and narrated with Shakespearean intensity by the able Richard Ferrone, this is a high- impact personal finance audio that sounds like it's speaking to us from the time of Jesus. Captivating fables gently urge listeners to use their talents to accumulate money, invest a tenth of what's earned, spend thoughtfully on necessities, save for the future, and avoid risks. A well-crafted analysis explains what separates the ownership class from the class of people who work for others. We're reminded also that our place in the pecking order depends on our internal values and the way we manage our money.

There are no young lovers flirting and bedding each other, thinking they've invented the act--this novel centers around adults. The main characters have been married for more than 20 years and believe they know each other absolutely. A trip to Italy shows them there is still much to learn. <p> Catherine "Cat" Gaillard narrates her own story, beginning with a gothic childhood of the sort that inspires folk ballads and tasteless jokes. Orphaned at age 5 when her parents are killed in a freakish accident, Cat chooses to live on Morgan's Mountain as the ward of chilly, crazy grandparents, though saner family members are willing to take her in. She reasons that, "From there I would always know what was coming. From there I would see it long before it saw me."</p><p> The rest of the story follows Cat and her husband, Joe, on their journey of midlife discovery. They both flirt with the possibility of an affair, they bicker, challenge assumptions, make new friends, drink too much, eat fabulous food, and tour Rome, Florence, and Venice. It's like being there. Siddons lets you inhabit Cat's mind and experience her struggle to overcome agoraphobia, her uncertainties about Joe, and, most of all, her neophyte-traveler's view of Italy. <i>Hill Towns</i> is an exploration of a mature relationship, but it's also an effective travelogue. Read it and see if you don't start to crave <i>caff� granita</i> on the piazza. <i>--Brenda Pittsley</i></p><p>A single traumatic event in her childhood irrevocably marked Catherine Gaillard, leaving her stranded in her cloistered mountaintop Tennessee town for thirty years. But now she is embarking upon a life-changing trip to Italy with her husband, Joe, hoping to put the incident behind her forever. As they make their way across the breathtaking countryside of Tuscany with two other couples, Cat and Joe soon feel themselves being pulled in separate directions, and the fabric of their marriage begins to unravel. And a journey that began as a carefree tour crosses unexpected boundaries, carrying them deep into the heart of their relationship, becoming the ultimate test of their love.</p></p><h2>A Less Boring History of the World</h2><p>"Horrible history for adults."

As a boy, Daniel Rooke was an outsider. Ridiculed in school and misunderstood by his parents, Daniel could only hope that he would one day find his place in life. When he joins the marines and travels to Australia as a lieutenant on the First Fleet, Daniel finally sees his chance for a new beginning. As his countrymen struggle to control their cargo of convicts and communicate with nearby Aboriginal tribes, Daniel constructs an observatory to chart the stars and begin the work he prays will make him famous. But the place where they have landed will prove far more revelatory than the night sky. Out on his isolated point, Daniel comes to intimately know the local Aborigines and forges a remarkable connection with one girl that will change the course of his life. <i>The Lieutenant</i> is a remarkable story about the poignancy of a friendship that defies linguistic and cultural barriers, and shows one man that he is capable of exceptional courage.</p><p>Kate Grenville is a contributor for the following Houghton Mifflin Company Title: Albion&#39;s StoryGrenville&#x2019;s portrait of the obtuse yet engaging Rooke and her descriptions of this strange territory are marvelously evocative. . . . The fragility of the encounters [between Rooke and Tagaran] further heightens the suspense that Grenville so deftly sustains. Tragedy looms, of course, just outside the delicate frame of this elegiac novel, but Grenville allows us to marvel at one universe in the act of encountering another&#x2019; even as we dread the inevitable result.&#x201d; Anna Mundow, <i>The Boston Globe</i><br><br> [A] richly imagined portrait of a deeply introspective, and quite remarkable, man.&#x201d; Alison McCulloch, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br> Exquisite . . . Grenville has created a magnificent work of fiction that encompasses the excitement of adventure, the thrill of discovery, the mysteries of the unknown, the ambiguity of relationships and the ethical and moral dilemma of choosing between duty to country or to mankind.&#x201d; Corinna Lothar, <i>The Washington Times</i><br><br> A prescriptive plea for cultural understanding [that] draws revelatory connections between emotional empathy and scientific discovery. . . . The crisp prose of <i>The Lieutenant </i>[often] approaches poetry . . . [and] compels as a historical novel exploring the sins of Australia's colonial past, an admirable testament to the necessity that the West learn to appreciate rather than condemn the Other. But Grenville's most thrilling achievement is to filter that lesson in social acceptance through the computational consciousness of a man whose head is in the stars.&#x201d; Bill Marx, <i>Los Angeles Times</i><br><br>"What differentiates <i>The Lieutenant</i> from <i>The Secret River</i> is a surprising and refreshing theme of belonging and connectivity. Present are Grenville's consistent abilities to understand and re-birth history into a contextual narrative, but here those skills coalesce into an overarching message: 'Everything is part of every other thing, now and forever.' . . . Understanding and meaning [can be] found far from anything we could have imagined. <i>The Lieutenant</i> is a great read that reminds us the finding is possible."--Michelle AuBuchon, <i>Brooklyn Rail</i><br><br> Vivid . . . Delightful . . . Grenville&#x2019;s storytelling shines: the backdrop is lush and Daniel is a wonderful creation a conflicted, curious and endearing eccentric.&#x201d; <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br> Grenville displays a graceful touch with the characters and the history that so clearly move her, and her writing sparkles with life. Highly recommended.&#x201d; <i>Library Journal</i> (starred review)<br><br> Grenville follows The Secret River with another lyrical and literary exploration of the history of Australia. . . . Loosely based on historical facts, this novel of discovery is about much more than exploring new lands.

[It] has excited me more than any novel I&#x2019;ve read since those of W. G. Sebald.&#x201d; Diana Athill, author of <i>Somewhere Toward the End</i><br><br> [<i>The Lieutenant</i>] glows with life: imaginative in its re-creations, respectful of what cannot be imagined, and thoughtful in its interrogation of the past. . . . Grenville&#x2019;s most intellectually sophisticated novel to date.&#x201d; Kerryn Goldsworthy, <i>The Age </i>(Australia)<br><br> [<i>The Lieutenant</i>] has a potency and beauty that lingers in both the heart and mind&#x2019;s eye. . . . Rooke and Tagaran are superbly written, and Grenville conveys not only the sense of true kinship that grows between them, but also the euphoria of connection and understanding between two people from different universes. [The Lieutenant] visits a part of Australian black-white history and finds a true heart of goodness there.&#x201d; Lucy Clark, <i>The Sunday Telegraph </i>(Australia)<br><br> Grenville inhabits characters with a rare completeness . . . and writes with a poet&#x2019;s sense of rhythm and imagery. . . . [She] explores the natural rifts that arise between settlers and native people with a deep understanding of the ambiguities inherent in such conflicts . . . [and] occupies the mind of Rooke with a kind of vivid insistence, and his isolation and moral dilemmas become ours.&#x201d; Jay Parini, <i>The Guardian </i>(UK)<br><br> Masterful . . . Grenville&#x2019;s easy writing leads us gently toward the inevitable cultural collision, building subtle tension as the playing field becomes more and more uneven. And woven throughout this fictionalized history is a moving and compassionate glimpse into the proud intelligence of the Aboriginal tribes in that moment of hesitation before good intentions are swept aside in the name of queen and country.&#x201d; Judith Meyrick,<i> The Chronicle Herald</i><br><br> Grenville has fashioned an original, inviting tale that makes her country&#x2019;s colonial history as fresh as it is to her wide-eyed protagonist in 1788. . . . Grenville&#x2019;s prose is clear and clean . . . [with] an innocence to the voice that is almost reminiscent of a fairytale and its purposeful naivety well suits the point of view of a curious but inexperienced hero. . . . Basing her tale on real events and a real historical character, Grenville has brought imagination and compassion to the source of so much of Australia&#x2019;s retroactive hand-wringing. What distinguishes her portrayal of the Aboriginal culture is that for once appreciation, sympathy, and admiration get the better of impotent guilt.&#x201d; Lionel Shriver, <i>The Telegraph </i> (UK)<br><br> A particular kind of stillness marks out Grenville&#x2019;s characters as uniquely hers. . . . The relationship between the awkward soldier, in his red coat and brass buttons, and the young naked girl, is a beautifully uplifting piece of fiction. Nimbly avoiding categorizations of filial, fraternal or sexual love, their sharing of language and then understanding simply describes the love that one human being finally finds for another. . . . Between the words and among them, this is a profoundly uplifting novel one that leaves you understanding Rooke&#x2019;s premise: that 'Truth [needs] hundreds of words, or none.'&#x201d; Katy Guest, <i>The Independent</i> (UK)<br><br> The encounters between Rooke and the Gadigal, especially a young girl called Tagaran, are wonderfully shimmering and authentic gripping, I couldn't put it down.&#x201d; <i>Weekend Herald </i>(New Zealand)<br><br> An extraordinary adventure into the nature of language, culture and human communication. It is also a thrilling alternative history of modern Australia&#x2019;s beginnings. . . . Grenville&#x2019;s great victory in this book is to show us that language is so much more than vocabulary or even grammar and syntax . . . Grenville&#x2019;s writing is so clear as to be transparent All in all, an epiphanous book, her best, I think.&#x201d; <i>Listener</i><br><br> An intelligent, spare, always engrossing imagining of first contact, in which the fictionalization of history allows a comment about current postcolonial race relationships which escapes the didacticism of special pleading.&#x201d; Patrick Denman Flanery, Times Literary Supplement<br><br> In lucid prose and perfectly measured strides, Grenville lays down her riveting tale.&#x201d; Stephanie Cross, <i>The Daily Mail</i><br><br> Genuinely affecting, [<i>The Lieutenant</i>] is another capable tranche of character-based, historical fiction and a worthy foil to its predecessor.&#x201d; Melissa McClements,<i> Financial Times</i><br><br> Rooke and Tagaran . . . develop together the first stumbling vocabulary and grammar of an indigenous Australian language for English speakers. . . . This exploration project, undertaken marvelously as a language adventure, is an Australian fiction delight. . . . Grenville hasn&#x2019;t written a historical novel. She has written astutely about dark hearts today.&#x201d; Nigel Krauth,<i> Australian</i><br><br> [Grenville&#x2019;s] reflections on the relationship of language to life, perspective to meaning, literature to truth all sprout from the seeds of historical record and twine enticingly throughout the novel.&#x201d; Katharine England, <i>Adelaide Advertiser</i><br><br> [With <i>The Lieutenant</i>] Grenville achieves what few Australian writers have accomplished: a convincing paean to Australia&#x2019;s seductiveness. . . . Character is one of [Grenville&#x2019;s] strong suits, and this vision of a budding relationship between the sparkling Aboriginal girl and the sensitive young man of science is a triumph of imaginative history.

In the history of the medium, no one has ever quite equaled his unique talent.<br>In this first ever full-length biography of Lubitsch, undeniably one of the most important and influential film directors and artists of all time, critic and biographer Scott Eyman examines not just the films Lubitsch created, but explores as well the life of the man, a life full of both great successes and overwhelming insecurities. The result is a fascinating look at a man and an era - Hollywood's Golden Age.<br>Born in Berlin and trained first in the German theater, Lubitsch made the transfer to film quickly, as well as his move from actor to director. Transported to Hollywood in the 1920s with the help of Mary Pickford, Lubitsch brought with him a level of sophistication and subtlety previously unknown to American movie audiences, especially when it involved the cinematic treatment of sex. In the world Lubitsch created by films such as Love Parade, Trouble in Paradise and The Merry Widow, sex was a given, an automatic part of the social contract, a game whose rules were understood by all parties. He immediately made his mark on the fledgling industry and was quickly established as a director of unique quality and distinction.<br>Lubitsch's accomplishments as a filmmaker were many and significant:<br>In films such as The Merry Widow he virtually created the movie musical, and in the process greatly helped to establish the careers of Jeanette MacDonald and Maurice Chevalier.<br>In wickedly sophisticated films such as Trouble in Paradise and Design for Living, Lubitsch enchanted audiences with his unique "touch," creating a world of fantasy in which men are tall and handsome (unlike Lubitsch himself) and humorously adept at getting women into bed, and where all the women are beautiful and charming and capable of giving as well as receiving love.<br>He revived the flagging career of Marlene Dietrich and, in Ninotchka, crafted Greta Garbo's most successful film.<br>He became the Production Head of Paramount Pictures, an accomplishment unique in an industry that traditionally preferred that the actual filmmakers have no say in running the business.<br>Written with the cooperation of an extraordinary ensemble of eyewitnesses, and unprecedented access to the files of Paramount Pictures, Ernst Lubitsch: Laughter in Paradise is a biography as rich and diverse as its subject. The result is a book that is sure to please film buffs of all stripes and to especially delight the thousands who champion Lubitsch as the greatest filmmaker ever.</p><p><p>The only full-length biography of the legendary director who introduced European sophistication to Hollywood films, deftly balancing behind-the-scenes cinema history with keen biographical insight</p>Scott Eyman has written fifteen books, three of them <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers, including <i>John Wayne: The Life and Legend</i>. His most recent book is <i>Hank and Jim</i>. He has been awarded the William K. Everson Award for Film History by the National Board of Review.

Their book is a sort of guide to the Norwegian black metal scene, where, the authors claim, this latest, more rebellious form of heavy metal music originated. Moreover, Norway is the recent setting for the burning of numerous churches, and for two gruesome murders for which a small group of black metallers have been convicted. Whereas gangsta rappers might cite ancient African traditions that have been violently uprooted as a cause for their crimes against society, Norwegian black metal-heads cite the slaughter of their pagan traditions at the hands of early Christians as their justification. For most readers, such rationalizations will fall apart as they note that black metal kids murder their own kind (as, often, do gangsta rappers). It does not require 344 pages (plus appendices) to become disenchanted with the authors' rather disorganized history, but rabid fans will find much to savor here, such as lengthy interviews with the scene's icons. This is an exhaustive look at a few, extremely disturbed young men who, tragically, did not get Ozzy Osbourne's joke. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.Committed campaigners against rock culture excesses may enjoy this look at the weird world of <i>black metal</i> as much as the local goth contingent will. Centered in Norway, though not confined there, black metal is a refinement of heavy metal, the genre minions of decency loved to hate before the rise of gangsta rap. Combining the lyrical stance of <i>death metal</i> with the melodic stylings of <i>thrash</i>, black metal takes its name from the English band Venom's second album. But what distinguishes black metal from, say, Marilyn Manson, is that the Nordic tunesmiths aren't kidding. The ones cited here openly advocate and occasionally admit to suicide, murder, and church burnings. Satan worship and its trappings are important to the black metal ethos, yet many musicians and fans aren't Satan worshippers but Odin devotees, and some seek to revive notorious Norwegian Nazi puppet Vidkun Quisling's Universism. Though the prose is stiff in places and the presentation desultory at times, this is gripping stuff, a book about scary rock that is really scary. <i>Mike Tribby</i></p><h2>Your Life Is Your Message: Finding Harmony With Yourself, Others &amp; the Earth</h2><p>***COURTESY OF TWOBEARS BOOKS*** Once, while Mahatma Gandhi&#39;s train was pulling slowly out of the station, a European reporter ran up to his compartment window. &#34;Do you have a message I can take back to my people?&#34; he asked. It was Gandhi&#39;s day of silence, a vital respite from his demanding speaking schedule, so he didn&#39;t reply. Instead, he scrawled a few words on a scrap of paper and passed it to the reporter: &#34;My life is my message.&#34; This book offers a vision of personal growth that brings together the quest for inner fulfillment, the desire to contribute to the world, and the need to enrich personal relationships.

"Let her meddle with what she doesn't understand! Look at this letter! The man who wrote it will marry her, or murder her, or do for her somehow. He's a bounder, but he's not an English bounder.

He's got a country behind him that's upset people from the beginning of the world." <br>When a young English widow takes off on the grand tour and along the way marries a penniless Italian, her in-laws are not amused. That the marriage should fail and poor Lilia die tragically are only to be expected.

The time is a few years in the future. England has withdrawn from the Common Market and, on the brink of bankruptcy, has decided that salvation lies in a union - political, military and economic - with the United States. Theoretically it is to be an equal partnership; but to some people it soon begins to look like a takeover bid. Daphne du Maurier is concerned not only with what would happen to this country under what is virtually occupation, but also with the effect on human relationships. In Emma, looking at it all with clear young eyes, Daphne du Maurier has drawn one of her most enchanting heroines; and this engrossing book shows once again what a versatile and perceptive writer she is.</p><p>Dame Daphne du Maurier (1907-1989) wrote more than twenty-five acclaimed novels, short stories, and plays, including <b>Rebecca, My Cousin Rachel, Jamaica Inn,</b> and <b>The House on the Strand.</b> She was also a passionate and skillful chronicler of her own remarkable, famously artistic family. Now, this is one of three of her fine novels that have been reissued in the distinguished Virago Modern Classics series.In many ways the life of Daphne du Maurier resembles that of a fairy tale. Born into a family with a rich artistic and historical background, the daughter of a famous actor-manager, she was indulged as a child and grew up enjoying enormous freedom from financial and parental restraint. She spent her youth sailing boats, travelling on the Continent with friends, and writing stories. A prestigious publishing house accepted her first novel when she was in her early twenties, and its publication brought her not only fame but the attentions of a handsome soldier, Major (later Lieutenant-General Sir) Frederick Browning, who married her.</p><h2>Anno&#39;s Magical ABC: An Anamorphic Alphabet</h2><p>The distorted letters of the alphabet become quite clear when viewed with the help of the silver tube included with the book.</p><p></p><h2>Dragonflight (The Dragonriders of Pern, Vol. 1)</h2><p>At a time when the number of Dragonriders has fallen too low for safety and only one Weyr trains the creatures and their riders, the Red Star approaches Pern, threatening it with disaster</p><p>There are dragons all over Anne McCaffrey's house.

I remember the first time I went to visit her, when she was still living in her old, much smaller but very homey, house. My husband and I arrived at the doorstep, and she immediately began bustling about, frying up some of the bacon we'd brought and sharing a lovely late breakfast with us before sending us off to the hotel for a nap.

The ostensible reason: so-called Communist influence. But in truth these women&#x2015;among them Dorothy Parker, Lena Horne, and Gypsy Rose Lee&#x2015;were, by nature of their diversity and ambition, a threat to the traditional portrayal of the American family on the airwaves.

The all-white, male-dominated <i>Leave it to Beaver</i> America about which conservative politicians wax nostalgic existed largely because of the forcible silencing of these forty-one women and others like them.

Set in the rebellion-torn Zaire of the 1960s, it is the story of a cynical Minister of State and his love for a beautiful prostitute, and the fluctuating balance of power in their relationship as they become enmeshed, both willingly and unwillingly, in the political intrigue and tribal loyalties that will destroy them. The Minister's reflections on their attachment comprise much of the tale, and though occasionally abstruse, they are eloquent and insightful. Rarely do we enter into the prostitute's point of view. The shifts of perspective between the cool observations of the Minister and those of the unidentified and unsettling second-person narrator keep us distanced from the charactersa masterful narrative parallel for the protagonists' detachment from their own lives. The novel's heavy sense of impending doom keeps us reading until the blistering conclusion. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Farmer and the Grill: A Guide to Grilling, Barbecuing and Spit-Roasting Grassfed Meat...and for Saving the Planet one Bite at a Time</h2><p><p><strong><em>The Farmer and the Grill</em> is filled with recipes specially devised to bring out the best in nutritious, Earth-friendly, pasture-raised meats.</strong></p> <p>In her first book, <em>The Grassfed Gourmet Cookbook</em>, author and livestock farmer Shannon Hayes introduced a radically simple concept: sustainable practices like pastured-based farming translate into food that is tastier, healthier, and better for both people and the planet.</p> <p>The key to getting the most out of pasture-raised meats, though, is understanding how to cook them properly. In <em>The Farmer and the Grill</em>, Hayes offers useful tips on grilling, barbecuing, and spit-roasting all cuts of pasture-raised meats: beef, lamb, pork, and poultry. Dozens of simple, straightforward recipes provide all the basic cooking instructions, plus directions on how to make a variety of herb rubs, marinades, and barbecue sauces to accompany the meats. Traditional techniques such as Southern barbecue and Argentine-style asado cooking will help readers grill like the pros. And specific notes from pasture-based farmers on dealing with natural variations in grassfed meats will ensure success every time.</p> <p>Creative and mouth-watering recipes include Tamari-Orange Whiskey Kebabs, Grilled Steaks in a Cilantro-Olive Paste, and Rack of Lamb with a Spiced Fig Crust. Plus, special sidebars on choosing meats, basic cooking techniques, and other topics mean that socially conscious cooks will gain a real understanding of grassfed meat and why it is starting to occupy a central place on the American dinner plate.</p></p><p><p>Shannon Hayes works with her family raising grassfed meat on Sap Bush Hollow Farm in upstate New York.

It is glamorous, colorful, and instantly conjures up a romantic set of associations - the sway of the kilt, the skirl of the pipes, and the spectacle of brave Highlanders fighting for freedom against an imperial power...From the Bruces to the Katsushika Japanese Dancers, from the chieftains of the medieval period to Neil Armstrong who took his family tartan to the moon, tartan is surely one of the most enduring symbols of national pride and individual honor. It is also a peculiarly inclusive, infinitely adaptable way of proclaiming that we belong to something, and perhaps it is this that makes it so beloved.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Clogs and Clogmaking (Shire Library)</h2><p>Clogs were a popular form of footwear in Britain from the beginning of the nineteenth century to the middle of the twentieth, when they began to be perceived as unfashionable, utilitarian and a sign of poverty. The craft of clogmaking has since declined almost to extinction and there are very few skilled craftsmen still practicing the art of clog sole cutting today. Clogs, however, do continue to be manufactured by machine, with clog dance teams accounting for much of this demand, and some people still choose to make their own uppers and attach them to machine-made clog soles. Jeremy Atkinson, one of only a few clogmakers who still make the entire clog by hand, examines the origins and development of clogs and the processes used in their manufacture. Illustrated with black and white photographs that demonstrate the different techniques and materials used in clog making, this book discusses the various designs and uses of these unique shoes, as well as their place in the social structure of Britain, which may ultimately have led to their decline.</p><p>Jeremy Atkinson is one of only two or three clogmakers who still make the entire clog by hand. He received a government grant for six months&#39; &#39;in service training with a craftsman&#39; (a course which is now defunct), during which he learned to carve the soles by hand. Later he received a research and development grant which enabled him to travel around Britain interviewing the few surviving master clogmakers, all of them well over seventy years old. He now specializes in making traditional nineteenth-century styles in his workshop in Hereford.</p><h2>Contagious Leadership Workbook</h2><p><p>What does it mean to be a good leader?

He later held posts at Harvard and Princeton, before taking up a professorship at the University of Minnesota. He won the Pulitzer Prize in 1965 for 77 Dream Songs, and he continued to build upon this series of poems, publishing the end result, The Dream Songs, in 1969. His Collected Poems was published after his death in 1991.For readers unattuned to what Thornbury here calls "Berryman's strange and dissonant music," this gathering of verse may unlock the poems' inner recesses. In his extensive introductory essay, the editor, who teaches at St. John's University in Minnesota, explores Berryman's poetry of disrupted syntax, of continual deaths and rebirths, of self-deceptions and ultimate self-understanding. He also provides a biographical context for the sonnets, satires and confessionals, taking into account the poet's peripatetic boyhood, his suppressed rage at his father's suicide, his metamorphoses as Cambridge don, alcoholic philanderer, itinerant professor-poet and suicide at age 57. Berry displayed his febrile inventiveness as early as Sonnets to Chris (1947), a cycle included here that is by turns romantically tender, cynical, manic, elegant and slangy; this edition brings together all of Berryman's published volumes of poetry except for The Dream Songs. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Family Tree</h2><p>THE ONCE FERTILE EARTH OF DORA HENRY'S CHILDHOOD HAS BEEN UNDERVALUED AND OVERDEVELOPED.

To get a woman in the White House, it&#x2019;s thought, would be an achievement for all women everywhere, a kind of trickle-down feminism.<br><br> In the run-up to the 2016 presidential election, the mantle of feminist elect has descended on Hillary Clinton, as a thousand viral memes applaud her, and most mainstream feminist leaders, thinkers, and organizations endorse her. In this atmosphere, dissent seems tantamount to political betrayal.<br><br> In <i>False Choices</i>, an all-star lineup of feminists contests this simplistic reading of the candidate. A detailed look at Hillary Clinton&#x2019;s track record on welfare, Wall Street, criminal justice, education, and war reveals that she has advanced laws and policies that have done real harm to the lives of women and children across the country and the globe.

He wrote about inarticulate men groping to express truths &#x201c;locked in wordlessness.&#x201d; He wrote about America&#x2014;the land and the people&#x2014;as though it were one living organism, and he did so more eloquently than anyone since Walt Whitman. In an extraordinarily prolific career that lasted from 1929 to the 1960s, John Steinbeck created stories and characters that, in the words of Pascal Covici, Jr., this volume&#x2019;s editor, combine &#x201c;the gusto of Homer ... along with the thoughtfulness of Emerson.&#x201d;<p><b>The Portable Steinbeck</b> is a grand sampling of this writer&#x2019;s most important works.

Can she depend on the kindness of strangers to get on the road again?<br><br>Elizabeth Wakefield feels something strong for teammate Sam Burgess--love or hate, she's not sure.&nbsp;&nbsp;When she finds out the real reason he's competing, her feelings burn out of control.<br><br>Tom Watts and Todd Wilkins are freaking.&nbsp;&nbsp;How could they accidentally leave Jessica behind? They're sure their team will get disqualified...and Elizabeth will have them both killed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Can they put aside their differences long enough to track down the wayward Wakefield?</p><p>"Come back, you morons!" Jessica Wakefield wailed, beating her fists in vain on the thick, bulletproof bar window as she watched Team One's Winnebago disappearing in a cloud of dust. A cold knot of panic twisted through her stomach as she ran over to the door and jiggled the lock one more time. No dice. She was locked in. <br><br>"Hey!" she yelled louder, rushing back to the window, but the Winnebago only shrank farther into the distance, barreling down the highway. Jessica blinked, disbelieving. <br><br><i>Are they completely stupid, or am I invisible? Maybe this is all just some kind of lame prank. And if it is, those jerks are going to get it--big time!</i> Jessica vowed as she stalked up and down the empty bar. She wasn't exactly in the mood for jokes. It was bad enough waking up all alone in a beer-sticky plastic booth in a karaoke bar in the middle of Nowheresville, South Dakota. Bad enough to discover that the Budweiser-for-brains bartender who was supposed to call her when her teammates returned had somehow allowed her to fall asleep and then forgotten all about her!<br><br><i>Or maybe he's in on the joke . . . ?</i> Jessica hoped feebly, trying to reassure herself that things weren't as puke-worthy as they looked. Yeah, right! Another glance at the ant-sized speck zooming into the horizon confirmed her fears. No one was coming back for her. She was stuck. <br><br><i>What on earth was I thinking?</i> Jessica smacked her open palm on the window. Looking back on it now--and literally looking at the back of the diminishing Winnebago--her decision to be part of Intense Cable Sports Network's summer Coast-to-Coast road trip contest seemed about as dumb as donating her summer to Greenpeace. <i>Not your finest hour!</i> Jessica chided herself, picturing a host of shopping sprees, Fourth of July parties, and potential hot guys she had given up. It was enough to make anyone want to drown themselves in drink. Especially if they were locked in a bar! But the very thought of a breakfast special of tequila shots was enough to make Jessica feel like hurling chunks. The bar reeked enough anyway, and all she wanted was a breath of fresh air. <br><br>As if on cue, a key jangled in the lock. <i>Saved by the moron!</i> Jessica thought venomously as the heavyset bartender lumbered through the door. "Good. You've arrived," she snarled. "The service has been a little slow!"<br><br>"Uh--what are you doing here?" he mumbled, scratching his head in confusion.<br><br>"Oh, just enjoying the view. " Jessica had to fight the urge to connect an ashtray with the guy's sloping forehead. "You locked me in, Einstein. Remember me?"<br><br>The bartender shuffled timidly toward the bar and started fiddling with a coffee machine. "Oh yeah. By the way, your friends didn't come back here last night. I think they must've hung out next door. They got a good jukebox next door. Sometimes people go there when they're sick of karaoke."<br><br>"Sick of karaoke?" Jessica repeated, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "Oh, that's impossible! Why, I just can't get enough of karaoke, as you can see!"<br><br>"Uh--coffee?"<br><br>"Listen, you big blockhead," Jessica snapped, her voice low and quivering with rage. "I got left behind because my teammates didn't realize I was here. So can it with the coffee and small talk and help me figure out what to do!"<br><br>"Funny your friends didn't notice you were missing," the bartender retorted, his voice calm and even. "They were parked right in front of the bar. Are you sure maybe they didn't get tired of your attitude and decide to leave you behind, missy?"<br><br>Jessica's eyes narrowed into slits. "You've got some nerve!" she shot back frostily. But inside her, a small seed of doubt began to harden and grow as memories of the night before--images she'd tried to keep down--pinpricked their way to the surface. Neil . . . <br><br>Jessica's face lit up like a halogen lamp at the very thought of Neil Martin. Everything had seemed so great between them. He'd made being stuck with a group of supremely uncool beings for four whole weeks totally worth the fuss and irritation. With his shaggy, coal black hair, shoulders that could span the Grand Canyon, and snappy sense of humor, Neil had seemed like the perfect sparring partner for Jessica. And it had seemed that he felt the same way. Jessica was convinced that anyone who'd seen her with Neil would have put out a major flirt alert on the vibe bouncing between them. Except for one little thing. Neil was gay. <br><br>Jessica still felt as if she'd been punched in the stomach when she remembered how much she'd fallen all over Neil the night before--only to be hit with a major brush-off. She could still picture the awkward look on his face when she'd confronted him with her feelings. He'd looked as if he'd rather be anywhere but with her, as if he wished the floor would turn to Jell-O and Jessica would sink right through it, her two-inch pink suede platforms leading the way to the underworld. . . . <br><br><i>He probably wishes we'd never even met!</i> Jessica thought miserably, cursing herself for letting her heart lead her into such an embarrassing mess. The only thing worse than complete and total rejection was complete and total humiliation. And maybe Neil felt it too. Maybe he was mad at her for forcing him into revealing such a personal part of himself. And maybe he'd decided the entire team would be better off without her. <br><br><i>But how could I have known?</i> Jessica wondered, swallowing hard to keep from breaking down into a sniveling wreck. It wasn't like Neil hadn't responded to her signals. He'd seemed just like any other guy Jessica had ever been interested in--interested in her. There was no warning sign in his behavior, nothing but the usual adoration Jessica was accustomed to getting from the guys she liked. Or maybe the famous Jessica Wakefield intuition was short circuiting! Jessica's eyes widened in fear. If that was true, she was as good as nailed into her coffin. Jessica minus her guy-dar was like a shoe without a heel--in other words, useless!<br><br>The thought was so terrifying, Jessica had to banish it from her mind. <i>Get it together, Wakefield,</i> she ordered herself, dismissing the tears of self-pity welling up behind her eyelids. <i>You're not helpless!</i> she told herself sternly. OK, so maybe she'd just lost her pride and a good friend all in one lousy evening. And maybe she was in the middle of nowhere. And maybe her team had purposely ditched her, left her behind. <i>Whatever! You don't need them!</i> she told herself. <i>You've got a driver's license and a credit card. You can rent your own wheels and pull a proactive Wakefield maneuver on them all!</i><br><br>Jessica brightened at the thought of spinning down the highway in a convertible. It would be fun--and she'd get free highlights from the beating rays of the sun as an added bonus. Thank goodness for American Express! Jessica sighed with relief as she raced over to the booth in search of her purse. But her purse was nowhere to be seen. <br><br>Jessica gulped as another unwanted memory prodded at her. Her purse was in the Winnebago!<br><br>"This is just great!" Jessica moaned, recalling how she'd slung her stuff into the Winnebago before going back into the bar. And far worse, she calculated, she had no clothes with her either. A major fashion and financial disaster! The same outfit two days in a row. Maybe even a week. Jessica felt as if Stephen King himself had personally designed this horror story for her. <i>Cash flow is one thing, but pink capri pants for the rest of my natural life? she thought in dismay. </i><i>This is purgatory!</i><br><br>Defeated, Jessica lay down in the booth, helplessness descending on her like a bad hangover. <i>If only Liz were here . . . </i>Elizabeth would know what to do. And she'd be dead calm too. Although the twins were identical, from their thick, honey blond hair to their blue-green eyes, Jessica had to acknowledge that Elizabeth was way more levelheaded than she. In the past the practical side of Elizabeth had always gotten on Jessica's nerves. But right now Jessica would give up all of the qualities that made her an exciting woman of the world for just one ounce of Elizabeth's practicality. <br><br><i>Or maybe I don't have to!</i> Jessica realized in excitement, sitting up and looking out the dirty window. Through all the drama of being left behind, Jessica had totally blanked on the fact that Team One wasn't the only team driving to the next event stop. Whatever dreary, midwestern one-horse town was next, everyone had to get there, including Team Two. <br><br>But just as suddenly as Jessica had thought of it, all hopes of being rescued by Elizabeth dissolved. She didn't see a single other RV parked outside. Team Two must have left before Team One--and so had everyone else. <i>Liz could be eating Eskimo Pie in Alaska by now, for all I know!</i> Jessica thought bleakly, nervously peeling the frosted baby blue nail polish from her thumb. One thing was for sure, wherever Elizabeth was, she was miles away from Wonderlust and totally unaware of Jessica's plight. <i>I'm nothing hut a distant memory,</i> Jessica thought, letting out a loud wail of despair. It was all too much. She might as well close her eyes and die. <br><br>"OK, missy, put a muffler on those lungs and tell me where you're headed. Maybe I can give you a ride." The bartender held out a mug of stale-smelling coffee, but Jessica turned away from him. <i>Great! Now the crown prince of Dorkdom thinks be can rescue me!</i> she thought. <br><br>"Look, I'm going miles away from here, buddy. And I doubt you've ever even left your hometown," Jessica added airily, still hopping mad that the guy had managed to lock her into the bar and then act so cool about it and not even apologize!<br><br>"So where are you going, big-city girl?" the bartender replied, chuckling. <br><br>"Far away from this place, that's for sure," J...</p><h2>The Kabbalistic Bible According to the Zohar, Torah, Talmud and Midrash</h2><p>The Torah is full of holy fire; it was written with a black fire upon a white fire... <p> The Bible is an user's guide, a road map to enhance your life and become like God.

First; he discerned diseases through a supernatural sign in his hand. Later, visions allowed him to discern sickness and more. Between 1946 and 1954, over 500,000 people accepted Jesus Christ as their Savior because of his preaching-and there was no way to estimate how many millions received healing because of his prayers. Discerning that the people were not accepting the spiritual depths and heights that God&#39;s Word and Spirit was offering unto them, William Branham felt the Spirit of God was calling him to do more. He knew that people came to his meetings for many reasons. Some people came because they believed the Spirit of Jesus Christ was present. Others came for the novelty and excitement of it, just as when people flocked to see Jesus healing the sick and multiplying wine, bread, and fish. But it was the teachings of Jesus that changed the history of the world. William Branham felt that God was calling him to teach more during his faith-healing campaigns. He believed his ministry could make a lasting, beneficial contribution to the Christian church. Starting in 1955, he not only taught Divine healing, he also taught other aspects of God&#39;s Word. God gave him a vision of a new stage to his ministry-a &#34;third pull&#34; (to use the angel&#39;s words)-which would surpass everything God had done through him in the past. Inevitably, he offended some people.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Pastoral Counseling</h2><p><p>In the contemporary church, pastors take on many roles.

A fifth-generation Texan, he spent his childhood in Austin and Dallas with parents and grandparents who loved to tell stories. His latest novel, BLACK JACK POINT was nominated for an Edgar Award. Jeff lives in Austin with his wife and two sons.Tensions rise in Port Leo, Tex., when porn star Pete Hubble, the black sheep son of a senator, returns to uncover the secrets surrounding his brother's long-ago disappearance. Pete brings some heavy baggage with him, the least of which is his producer and girlfriend, Velvet Mojo. When Pete turns up dead, seemingly by his own hand, rookie Judge Whit Mosley and police detective Claudia Salazar open an investigation that may cost him the election and them their lives. Agatha and Macavity award-winner Abbott (Distant Blood) populates his narrative with a number of colorful characters including a pompous southern sheriff, a wrestler turned evangelist, a shadowy psychotic killer named Blade, a corrupt female senator and a delightful sidekick who sticks to his ethics even if they don't always coincide with judicial law.

It parallels the story of Jean B., a filmmaker who abandons his wife and career to hole up in a Paris hotel, with that of Ingrid and Rigaud, a refugee couple he'd met twenty years before, and whose mystery continues to haunt him.</p><p>Jean B., the narrator of Patrick Modiano&#39;s Honeymoon, is submerged in a world where day and night, past and present, have no demarcations. Having spent his adult life making documentary films about lost explorers, Jean suddenly decides to abandon his wife and career, and takes what seems to be a journey to nowhere. He pretends to fly to Rio to make another film, but instead returns to his own Parisian suburb to spend his solitary days recounting or imagining the lives of Ingrid and Rigaud, a refugee couple he had met twenty years before, and in whom he had recognized a spiritual anomie that seemed to reflect and justify his own. Little by little, their story takes on more reality than Jean&#39;s daily existence, as his excavation of the past slowly becomes an all-encompassing obsession.Winner of the 2014 Nobel Prize in Literature, Patrick Modiano was born in Paris in 1945.

Very few of us perhaps are aware that he is the author of quite an original little Health-book in Gujarati. Those who think of him as a dreamy idealist or an unpractical visionary, with his head always in the clouds, will certainly be undeceived when they read this book replete from cover to cover with practical observations on the most practical question of Health. His views are of course radically different from the ordinary views that find expression in the pages of such books; in many cases, indeed, his doctrines must be pronounced revolutionary, and will doubtless be regarded by a certain class of readers as wholly impracticable.</p><p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (2 October 1869 &#x2013; 30 January 1948), commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi, was the preeminent leader of Indian nationalism in British-ruled India.

From 1956 to 1959 the Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in the Labor or Management Field (chaired by Sen. McClellan and guided by chief counsel Robert Kennedy) heard more than 1500 witnesses and uncovered a shocking story, proving that labor leaders, management, the underworld, and public officials, sometimes in combination, sometimes separately, had worked to cheat and intimidate the rank-and-file union members. These revelations resulted in convictions, tough labor reform legislation, and a public awareness of organized crime's insidious and corrosive influence. Writing crisply, with indignation but also with humor, Kennedy focuses on how unions are bought, sold, and sometimes stolen; how 'democracy' actually operated in Jimmy Hoffa's captive unions and what happened to the men who dared to oppose him; how Hoffa was tried on charges of attempting to plant a spy in the McClellan Committee; how an investigating committee works; how the Committee resisted external pressures, threats, and ploys to derail its efforts; and more. <i>The Enemy Within </i>is illuminated by firsthand knowledge and charged with the fire of personal conviction. With a new introduction by the chairman of the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial, this book remains a vivid testament to Robert Kennedy's early commitment to equal justice for leaders and laborers alike.</p><p><b>Robert F.

This revelation, and James&#x2019;s subsequent conviction, has thrown a spotlight on the other &#x201c;Hockey Night in Canada,&#x201d; where abuse of and by young players is appallingly common.<br><br>In <i>Crossing the Line</i>, Laura Robinson takes an unflinching look at abuse in junior hockey, the breeding ground for the NHL. She explains how this great sport has gone so bad, and challenges those who are a part of the world of hockey to rethink the game and consider ways to fix it.<br><br>The abuse takes many forms. It may be overtly sexual. It may be an overwhelming pressure on players &#x2013; removed from the support of their families and often living far from home &#x2013; to perform and to fit in. It often takes the form of degrading hazing rituals, many of which have violent sexual overtones, designed to take the players beyond their inhibitions and the normal limits of their aggression.<br><br>Robinson shows how the institutionalized abuse in hockey turns the players themselves into abusers. Yet when accusations are levelled against the players, team managers and owners rally around to protect them, applying pressure to have the charges dropped or the accuser discredited.<br><br>Junior hockey and the NHL are arenas for the display of what we consider to be ideal manhood. In <i>Crossing the Line</i>, Laura Robinson shows how damaging it can be when the participants in this often violent spectacle are unleashed on the real world.</p><p><b>Laura Robinson</b> is a freelance journalist whose work on sports and gender issues has appeared in the <i>Globe and Mail</i>, <i>Toronto Star</i>, <i>Canadian Living</i>, <i>Toronto Life</i>, <i>Saturday Night</i>, and <i>Ms</i>. magazine.

As a child in Abyssinia he watched the glorious armies of Ras Tafari returning from hand-to-hand battle, their prisoners in chains; at the age of 23 he made his first expedition into the country of the Danakil, a murderous race among whom a man&#39;s status in the tribe depended on the number of men he had killed and castrated. His books, &#34;Arabian Sands&#34; and &#34;The Marsh Arabs&#34;, tell of his two sojourns in the Empty Quarter and the Marshes of Southern Iraq. In this autobiography, Wilfred Thesiger highlights the people who most profoundly influenced him and the events which enabled him to lead the life of his choice.</p><p>Wilfred Thesiger was born in 1910 in Ethiopia. From 1930 Thesiger travelled through remote areas of Africa, the Middle East and Asia. His journeys and his books have won him numerous prestigious awards over the years. In 1968 he was made a CBE; he was honoured with a KBE in 1995.Perhaps the last of the great romantic gentleman-explorers, Thesiger, author of Arabian Sands and The Marsh Arabs, here looks back on an extraordinary life. He was born in Abyssinia (Ethiopia) to British diplomatic parents who were friends of Emperor Haile Selassie. Thesiger remembers Addis Ababa, the capital, as a village with grass huts, no roads and colorful ceremonies. He attended Eton and Oxford, then returned to Africa for the first of many journeys, exploring the Awash River (home to the dreaded Danakil, whose warriors killed randomly to prove their manhood and collected their victims' genitals for trophies). As a district officer in the Sudan Political Service, Thesiger had further opportunities to travel in desert lands and meet nomadic tribes. During World War II, he served with Orde Wingate's troops, liberating Abyssinia from the Italians; later, he fought behind the lines in the Western Desert. In addition to superb adventure, Thesiger gives a fine portrait of the waning days of the British Empire in the Sudan and of the last revolution in Ethiopia.

The title of the book was A Rebours (translated both as Against the Grain and Against Nature). Its author Joris-Karl Huysmans wrote it as a seductive textbook of decadence, as an antidote to banal naturalism or realism. Symbolism, whose influence was felt well into the modernist era, was an artistic religion-substitute, a spiritually charged cult of beauty. A Symbolist picture or sculpture is mysterious on purpose. In place of intellectual comprehension, the work seeks to have the beholder experience its mysterious depth like a vision. It is no wonder that Symbolists created some of the most fascinating artworks of their age.</p><p>Norbert Wolf gratuated in art history, linguistics and medieval studies at the universities of Regensburg and Munich.

Faraway lights on rafters and spires appear closer than they are, and sounds are difficult to discern. The backfiring of a pickup might be mistaken for a gunshot, or the simple creaking of a barn door could be confused with an animal's cry...<br>On one such night in November 1990, Alydar, the thoroughbred industry's preeminent sire, was found mysteriously injured in his stall. Despite extraordinary veterinary efforts, the stallion, insured for $36.5 million, was put down hours later. So begins the tragic demise of Calumet Farm and one of America's largest family fortunes. Wild Ride is Ann Hagedorn Auerbach's investigation of the fast-track, multibillion-dollar thoroughbred industry and of the fall of Calumet - the inside story of a financial debacle that reached farther than anyone could have imagined.<br>Founded in 1924 by Chicago mogul William Monroe Wright, Calumet Farm was to the world of thoroughbred racing what the New York Yankees were to baseball or the Boston Celtics to basketball - a sports dynasty. The stable bred so many superstars that it became the standard by which all achievements were measured in the horse racing industry. But during the 1980s, J. T. Lundy, the son of a sharecropper who married a Wright heir and whose lifelong dream was to rule Calumet, swept the stately institution into a high-stakes venture that all too quickly became a web of financial schemes involving notorious deal makers, huge bank loans, priceless art, jet planes, and alleged Mafia ties. By the fall of 1990, no one - not the media, the banks, or the family - knew how financially destitute Calumet had become. Beyond its pristine white fences was a house of cards soon to collapse into a morass of lawsuits and despair, revealing the secrets of a family, an industry, and a decade of greed.<br>Through astute investigative reporting, the author pieces together the Calumet puzzle, revealing an array of highly questionable practices and spinning a compelling tale that brings to life a gallery of colorful characters from the farm's glittery past. As the mystery unfolds the questions mount: were millions of dollars hidden in offshore bank accounts? Who was to blame - the family, the board of directors, the bankers, the lawyers? Was it possible that a stable dedicated for decades to producing superior racehorses had become so desperate that it could survive only by destroying what it had created - its prize stallion, Alydar?<br>Wild Ride chronicles the making and unmaking of a great American fortune. At once a family saga, an expose, and a mystery, it is also a portrait of an industry that succumbed to the temptations of the speculative era known as the Bluegrass Bubble. When the bubble exploded, an American institution lay in ruins.</p><p><b>Ann Hagedorn Auerbach</b> is a former <i>Wall Street Journal</i> reporter, and has also written for <i>The San Jose Mercury News</i>, <i>The New York Daily News</i>, and <i>The Washington Post</i>. She lives New York City.Wild Ride&nbsp;1<p>Calumet Farm sits on a high plateau in central Kentucky, a land of rolling savannahs known as the Bluegrass and the world center of the thoroughbred horse industry. Here, partly because of an accident of nature, breeders have produced more champion racehorses than on any other piece of land in the world.</p><p>The geological accident occurred more than 450 million years ago. At that time, while the eastern United States was still under water, great collisions on the earth&#x2019;s surface forced the formation of mountains where the Appalachians stand today. Over the next 200 million years, a pattern emerged: the mountains eroded, the collisions resumed, and new mountains rose, only to erode once again. As each range of mountains formed, the impact sent waves of the earth&#x2019;s crust westward. Of the many waves, one grew until it formed a high ground that consisted largely of limestone and measured fifty miles across and several hundred miles long, extending from what is now Ohio to southern Tennessee.</p><p>On the surface of this high ground was a dark brown soil, nourished by the limestone beneath it and uncommonly rich in phosphate from millions of deposits of shells and skeletons. The soil also contained an abundance of calcium, but it was the phosphate, normally found at such concentration only on ocean floors, that would dazzle geologists for centuries. The grass that grew from this soil was unique in its ability to nurture strong bones in the animals that grazed upon it. And the greatest concentration of the soil was in a 2,500-square-mile area whose center would someday be Fayette County, Kentucky, the heart of the Bluegrass.</p><p>Thousands of years after the first grass grew on the high plateau and many miles away, horse breeders in England began a centuries-long pursuit that would have as much impact on the future of the Bluegrass as geology. Their quest was the search for a new type of horse to take advantage of a new kind of weapon&#x2014;gunpowder.</p><p>Horses were used mainly to transport men, supplies, and weapons until the Normans, in 1066, won the Battle of Hastings with the help of superior horses. For several centuries thereafter, the breeding of a sturdy mount capable of carrying the 350-pound weight of a knight in full armor was a critical part of military strategy. But with the invention of gunpowder in the fourteenth century, armor became obsolete and armies needed fast, agile horses capable of darting quickly out of the range of fire. In the Middle Ages, though, the only light horses in England didn&#x2019;t have the stamina for war, while the strong horses were too slow.</p><p>For centuries the English tried, without success, to create the perfect steed. By the sixteenth century, not only armies sought the new breed, but horsemen did, too, because racing was growing in popularity, especially in the royal courts of James I, Charles II, and Queen Anne. For the inventive breeder who could find the right combination of speed and stamina, there were big profits to be made. The breakthrough came in the late seventeenth century when the English began breeding their mares to stallions from North Africa and the Middle East. From these matches came the &#x201c;invention&#x201d; of the thoroughbred horse.</p><p>Every thoroughbred&#x2019;s male line extends back to one of three sires: the Byerly Turk, the Darley Arabian, and the Godolphin Barb. Captain Richard Byerly captured the first of these, a black warhorse, during a 1688 battle in Turkey, shipping it to England in 1689. Around 1704 the merchant Thomas Darley purchased the second stallion in Syria and sent it to his brother, a breeder in England. By most accounts a North African ruler sent the third stallion, born in Yemen in 1724, as a gift to the king of France. But the king didn&#x2019;t like the looks of the horse and discarded it. A few years later, a Frenchman walking along the streets of Paris noticed a horse with welts on its back and wounds on its legs pulling a cart. He rescued the horse, which was the Yemen stallion, nursed it back to health, and sold it to the second earl of Godolphin, who then took the stallion to his farm in Newmarket, England, to breed with his finest mares.</p><p>The new breed ranged in size from fourteen hands&#x2014;a hand measures four inches&#x2014;to seventeen hands tall from ground to withers (the point where the base of the neck and top of the shoulder meet), with powerful muscles, especially in its hindquarters, to propel its stride. Bred for speed, it had a high-strung, fiery nature, which gave it the classification, in breeding parlance, of a &#x201c;hot blood,&#x201d; as opposed to a &#x201c;cold blood&#x201d; like the heavy animals used to support the armored knights and the horses that toiled in fields. A lithe, elegant animal with the grace of a gazelle and the endurance of a larger mammal, the thoroughbred was capable of carrying weight while running at high speeds.</p><p>During the last half of the eighteenth century hundreds of thoroughbred horses were shipped from England to the New World, where racing was in vogue and the demand for faster and faster horses was high. Horse racing had become so popular on the streets of colonial towns that it was considered a public nuisance. Soon tracks dotted the landscape from New York and Virginia to Maryland and the Carolinas. Even George Washington indulged; a 1772 diary entry shows that he had lost one-sixth of a pound at a track in Annapolis.</p><p>Thoroughbreds didn&#x2019;t arrive on Kentucky&#x2019;s high plateau until about 1800, thirty years after Daniel Boone&#x2019;s first expedition to what was then the untamed sector of Virginia. It was Boone, on his 1769 trip, who might have brought the first horses to the region, though they were probably only pack animals. Still, it was Boone&#x2019;s splendorous tales that lured others with better horses to the lush rolling savannas. Accounts of his two-year trip gushed with descriptions of a land covered with dark soil that grew an abundance of herbs, wild rye, and wild lettuce and that fed a bountiful supply of game, including turkey, deer, bear, and buffalo. There were walnut trees, blue ash, buckeyes, and the biggest oak trees he had ever seen.</p><p>Soon a rush of settlers from the Carolinas, Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania crossed mountains and coal-filled valleys to settle on the high plateau. Most were from Virginia, where horsemen were by far the best among the New World&#x2019;s breeders, a skill they took to the new land. And although none knew of the events of 450 million years before or were aware of the unique composition of the soil and grass, early annals show they did acknowledge the weather as a significant factor in raising their horses. Similar to parts of England and Ireland, the high plateau was temperate. Foals and yearlings were spared the harsh cold of the North and the even harsher heat of the South. And the new grass of spring came in as early as mid-March, at least a month before what most of the settlers were accustomed to. This meant the grass was edible by late March or early April, giving newborn foals early nourishment, a head start for building strong bones.</p><p>The first time on record that the grass was referred to as &#x201c;the Bluegrass&#x201d; was apparently in a 1795 ad in the Kentucky Gazette, selling a plantation &#x201c;rich with the Bluegrass.&#x201d; Though the phosphate-rich soil gave the grass unique qualities and the term &#x201c;Bluegrass&#x201d; would help to market sales of the land and its products for centuries to come, the strain of grass itself was probably not indigenous to the high plateau, and it was not all that blue.</p><p>The grass was part of the Gramineae family and the genus Poa. In Kentucky the strain was Poa pratensis, which means literally meadow grass. It is unclear how it ended up in Kentucky; filling the gaps of historical fact is a mountain of folklore about its origins. Some say the grass came from England during the last twenty-five years of the eighteenth century. In one story, an Englishman who accompanied Boone to Kentucky brought the seed. Another tale claims a settler carried the seeds in a thimble from England. Yet another credits a man named Blue who supposedly migrated from Pennsylvania, spotted the grass already growing in Kentucky, and named it after himself. Another account attributes the label Bluegrass to a simple mixup of names. A strain of the same genus, Poa compressa, found in parts of Canada does in fact have a discernible blue tint.</p><p>The grass in Kentucky is remarkably thick and lush, growing eighteen inches to twenty-four inches tall and rippling in the wind in the same memorable way as a field of wheat in Kansas. Its deep green hue in springtime is startling in its intensity, especially on a sunny day. And in the early morning light, as the sun&#x2019;s rays reflect off dewy blades of grass, its tint is slightly mauve, which might be why some nineteenth-century landscape artists in Kentucky painted the grass in tones of pink. Just how blue it is differs from one account to another. Some locals say they&#x2019;ve never seen the blue. Others were told as children they could see blue grass on the night of a full moon if they stood in a field, bent over, and looked upside down between their legs.

Before he reached Dell, Sawyer caught his arm and drew him up short. "Take it easy, Case."<br><br>Emma covered her mouth with a shaking hand, crying while trying not to cry, held tight by her father's grip even as she attempted to inch away from him. She wouldn't look at any of them, her narrow shoulders hunched in embarrassment&#x2014;and possibly pain.<br><br>Casey's heart hurt, and his temper roiled. Emma's pretty brown eyes, usually so warm and sexy, were downcast, circled by ruined makeup and swollen from her tears. There was a bruise on her cheek, just visible in the glow of the porch light.<br><br>Casey felt tight enough to break as a kind of animal outrage that he'd never before experienced struggled to break free. Every night he'd thought about seeing Emma again, and every night he'd talked himself out of it.<br><br>Not once had he considered that he'd see her like this.<br><br>His vision nearly blurred as he heard Emma sniff and watched her wipe her eyes with a shaking hand.<br><br>With unnecessary roughness, her father shoved her forward and she stumbled across the wide porch before righting herself and turning her back to Casey. Without a word, she held on to the railing, staring out at the moonlit yard. Her broken breathing was audible over the night sounds of wind and crickets and rustling leaves.<br><br>"Do you know what your damn son did?" Dell demanded.<br><br>Casey felt Sawyer look at him but he ignored the unasked questions and instead went to Emma, taking her arm and pulling her close. It didn't matter why she was here; he wanted to hold her, to tell her it'd be all right.<br><br>Drawn into herself, Emma sidled away from him, whispering a broken apology again and again. She hugged her arms around herself. Casey realized the night was cool, and while Dell wore a jacket, Emma wore only a T-shirt and jeans, as if she'd been pulled away without having time to grab her coat. Since he was shirtless, he couldn't offer her anything. He tried to think, to figure out what to do, but he couldn't get his brain to work. He felt glued to the spot, unable to take his gaze off her.<br><br>She needed his help.<br><br>Honey came to the same realization. "Why don't we all go inside and talk?"<br><br>Looking horrified by that proposition, Emma backed up. "No. That's not&#x2014;"<br><br>"Be quiet, girl!" Her father reached for her again, his anger and his intent obvious.<br><br>Casey stepped in front of him, bristling, coiled. "Don't even try it." No way in hell would he let Dell touch her again.<br><br>Face mottled with rage, her father shouted, "You think you get some say-so, boy? You think what you've done to her gives you that right?"<br><br>Without moving his gaze from the man in front of him, Casey said, "Honey, will you take Emma inside?"<br><br>Honey looked at her husband, who nodded. Casey hadn't had a single doubt what his father would do or say. Not once in his entire life had he ever had to question his father's support.<br><br>Never in his life had he been more grateful for it.<br><br>Again, Emma tried to back away, moving into the far shadows of the big porch. Casey snapped his gaze to hers, so attuned to her it seemed he felt her every shuddering breath. "Go inside, Emma."<br><br>She bit her lip, big tears spilling over her blotchy cheeks and clinging to her long lashes. Her mouth trembled. "Casey, I..."<br><br>"it's all right." He struggled to keep his voice soft, comforting, but it wasn't easy&#x2014;not while he could see the hurt in her eyes and feel her very real distress. "We'll talk in a little bit."<br><br>Speaking low and gentle, Honey put her arm around Emma, and reluctantly, Emma allowed herself to be led away. The front door closed quietly behind them.<br><br>With his daughter out of sight, Dell seemed more incensed than ever. He took two aggressive steps forward. "You'll do more than talk. You'll damn well marry her."<br><br>Casey gave him a cool look of disdain. That Dell could treat a female so callously made him sick to his stomach, but that he'd treat his own daughter that way brought out all Casey's protective instincts. More than anyone else he knew, Emma needed love and understanding. Yet, her own father was throwing her out, deliberately humiliating her.<br><br>"You brought her here," Casey growled. "You've delivered her to my doorstep, to <em>me.</em> What she or I do now is no concern of yours. Go home and leave us the hell alone."<br><br>Though Casey knew it would only complicate things more, he wanted to tear Dell apart. It wouldn't strain him at all. He was taller, stronger, with raw fury adding to his edge. He deliberately provoked Dell, and waited for his reaction.<br><br>It came in a lightning flash of curses and motion. The older man erupted, lunging forward. Smiling with intent, anxious for the confrontation, Casey braced himself.<br><br>Unfortunately, Sawyer caught Dell by his jacket collar before Casey could throw his first swing.<br><br>At well over six feet tall, solid with muscle, Sawyer wasn't a man to be messed with. He slammed Dell hard into the side of the house, and held him there with his forearm braced across his throat. He leaned close enough that their noses nearly touched.<br><br>"You come onto my property," Sawyer snarled, looking meaner than Casey had ever seen him look, "treating your only daughter like garbage and threatening my son?" He slammed Dell again, making his head smack back against the wood siding. "unless you want me to take you apart right now, which I'm more than willing to do, I suggest you get hold of your goddamn temper."<br><br>Dell's face turned red from Sawyer's choking hold, but he managed a weak nod. When Sawyer released him, he sagged down, gulping in air. It took him several moments, and Casey was glad that Emma had gone inside so she didn't hear her father's next words.<br><br>Wheezing, Dell eyed both Sawyer and Casey. "You're so worried about Emma, fine. She's yours." He spit as he talked, his face distorted with anger and pain. "You and your son are welcome to her, but don't think you can turn around and send her back home."<br><br>"To you?" Casey curled his lip. "Hell no."<br><br>Something in the man's eyes didn't make sense. The fury remained, no doubt about that. But Dell also looked...desperate. And a bit relieved. "You swear?"<br><br>He should have hit the son of a bitch at least once, Casey thought. He nodded, and forced the next words out from between clenched teeth. "You just make sure you stay the hell away from her."<br><br>Glaring one last time, Dell stepped around Sawyer and stomped down off the porch. At the edge of the grass, he stopped, his shoulders stiff, his back expanding with deep breaths, and for a long moment he hesitated. Casey narrowed his eyes, waiting. For Emma's sake, he half hoped her father had a change of heart, that he showed even an ounce of concern or compassion.<br><br>Dell looked over his shoulder at Casey. His mouth opened twice but no words were spoken. Finally he shook his head and went to his battered truck. He didn't glance back again. His headlights came on and he left the yard, squealing his tires and spewing gravel.<br><br>Casey stood there, breathing hard, his hands curled into fists, his whole body vibrating with tension. The enormity of the situation, of what he'd just taken on, nearly leveled him. He squeezed his eyes shut, trying to think.<br><br>Jesus, what had he done?<br><br>Sawyer's hand slipped around the back of his neck, comforting, supportive. A heavy, uncomfortable beat of silence passed.<br><br>"What do you want to do first, Case?" Sawyer spoke in a nearly soundless murmur, his voice disappearing in the dark night. "Talk to me, or talk to Emma?"<br><br>Casey looked at his dad, a man he loved and respected more than anyone else on earth. He swallowed. "Emma."<br><br>Nodding, Sawyer turned them both around and headed for the door. Casey hoped a few answers came to him before the morning light began creeping over the lake. Because, at the moment, he had no idea what the hell was going on.<br><br>Emma heard the opening and the closing of the front door. She squeezed her eyes shut, horrified, ashamed, scared spitless.<br><br>And oddly relieved.<br><br>More tears leaked out, choking her, burning her cheeks and throat. What had she done? What choice had she been given?<br><br>Honey touched her arm in a motherly way. "Drink your hot chocolate. And Emma, everything will be okay. You'll see."<br><br>Shaking down deep in her soul, Emma wiped at her eyes. She felt like a child, and knew she looked more like a barroom whore. Her makeup had long since been ruined and her nose and eyes were red. Her hair was a wild mess and her T-shirt was dirty.<br><br>Though the Hudson household was cozy and warm, she still felt chilled from the inside out. In that moment, she wondered if she'd ever be warm again.<br><br>Hugging herself in self-conscious dismay, she wished she could just disappear. She didn't belong in this house with these nice respectable people. But disappearing wasn't an option. She'd gotten herself in this mess and now she had to face them all. She had to explain.<br><br>She owed Casey at least that much.<br><br>At that moment, barefoot and shirtless, Casey came around the corner into the kitchen. His muscled arms crossed over his chest as he stopped in front of the kitchen table where she sat. His light-brown eyes, filled with compassion and confusion, warmed to glittering amber as he looked her over.<br><br>Stomach churning in dread, Emma flicked her gaze away.<br><br>Casey's father, Sawyer, stood behind him. Honey sat beside her. She felt surrounded, circled by their concern and curiosity, hemmed in by their kindness.<br><br>The damn tears welled up again and she felt herself start to shudder. Oh, God, if she bawled like a baby now she'd never forgive herself.<br><br>His expression solemn, Casey held out his hand. "Let's me and you talk a little, Emma."<br><br>She stared at him through a haze of tears.<br><br>Sawyer frowned. "Casey."<br><br>"Just a few minutes, Dad. I promise."<br><br>Honey sent Sawyer a pointed look, then patted Emma's shoulder. "You can use the family room. Sawyer and I will make sandwiches and join you in just a few minutes."<br><br>Keeping her head bowed so she wouldn't have to make eye contact with anyone, Emma left her chair. She didn't want to take Casey's hand, and tried to walk around him, but he caught her and his fingers laced into hers. His hand was big and warm, strong and steady. Reassuring.<br><br>Normally, just being near him made her feel more secure. But not this time.<br><br>To her amazement, when he reached the family room, Casey sat down and tugged her into his lap. She couldn't remember anyone ever holding her like that before. Emma was so shocked she almost bolted upright, but Casey wrapped both arms around her and pulled her so tightly to him, her head just naturally went to his shoulder. Her shaking increased.<br><br>Very gently, Casey stroked one hand up and down her back. "Em? Tell me what's going on."<br><br>Despite her resolve, she clutched at him. "I'm so sorry, Casey. So, so sorry."<br><br>He pushed her hair away from her face, then reached for a box of tissues on the end table and held them in front of her. Emma blew her nose, but it didn't help. The tears kept coming and she couldn't make them stop. "I didn't mean to get you involved, I swear."<br><br>Calmly, as if she hadn't just turned his life upside down, he said, "Involved in what?"<br><br>That was the thing about Casey. He was always calm, always so mature and sure of himself that, without thinking, she'd used his name and now... Emma grabbed for three more tissues. This was where she had to be careful. "I told my parents that I'm pregnant."<br><br>Casey went very still. Silence hung heavy in the air, broken only by her gasping breaths and awful sniffling. Casey sat there, tall and proud and strong, while she fell apart like a deranged child.<br><br>In that moment, Emma hated herself.<br><br>His hand began stroking her again. "I take it they weren't too happy about it?"<br><br>She laughed, but the humor faded into a wail. "I couldn't think of what else to do."<br><br>"So you came to me?"<br><br>He didn't seem nearly as outraged as she had expected. But then Casey was so different from any other guy she knew, she didn't know what to expect from him. He had a good handle on everything, on his life, his temper, his future.<br><br>"It's not...not what you think." This was even harder than she'd imagined. On the silent drive to his house, with her father fuming beside her, she'd tried to prepare herself, tried to make decisions. But this was the worst thing she'd ever done.<br><br>"No?" His thumb carefully smoothed over the bruise on her cheek.<br><br>God, she wished he'd say something more, maybe yell at her or throw her out. His calm destroyed what little control she'd been able to hold on to. "No." She shook her head and leaned away from the gentleness of his touch. It took one breath, then another, before she could speak convincingly. "I don't need or want anything from you, Case."<br><br>The intensity of his darkened gaze seeped into her and she tried to look away.<br><br>Gently, Casey brought her face back up to his. "Then why are you here, Em?"<br><br>"I just. " <em>I had to escape.</em> She drew a shaking breath and attempted to gather herself together. The last few hours had seemed endless, and the night was far from over. "I needed to get away and I couldn't think of anything else."<br><br>A rap on the door made her jerk, and she looked up to see Sawyer and Honey standing there, each carrying a tray. Sawyer held sandwiches and Honey held mugs of hot chocolate.<br><br>Emma started to groan. God, they were like Leave it to freakin' Beaver or something, so homey and together that nothing shook them for long, not even the neighborhood riffraff dropping in with a bombshell that should have disrupted the rest of their lives.<br><br>Envy formed a vise around her heart, but she knew she'd never belong to a family like theirs. They'd never want her.<br><br>Her own family didn't.<br><br>Sawyer's smile appeared strained but kind. "I think we should all do a little talking now."<br><br>He set the tray on the coffee table and settled into a chair. Honey did the same. They both seemed to ignore the fact that she'd ended up perched on Casey's lap, held in his strong arms. But the second Emma realized just how that would look, she shot to her feet. Before she could move too far away, Casey leaned forward and caught her wrist. Unlike her father's grip, his was gentle and warm.<br><br>Casey's hold offered comfort not restraint.<br><br>He came to his feet beside her, and she had the awful suspicion he wanted to provide a united front to his parents. He faced his father squarely, without an ounce of uncertainty or embarrassment. "Emma is pregnant."<br><br></p><h2>Tables of the Law</h2><p>The Tables of the Law recounts the early life of Moses, his preparations for leading his people out of Egypt, the Exodus itself and the incidents at the oasis of Kadesh, as well as the engraving of the stone tables of the law at Sinai.In Thomas Manns ironic and incisive style, this story, the most dramatic and significant in the Hebrew Bible, takes on a new, and at times witty, life and meaning. He wrote himself that he wanted to bring this far and legendary figure close to the modern reader in an intimate, natural and convincing manner.Like Joseph and His Brothers, it represents Manns art at his best. His tale of the ethical founding and moulding of people sharply rebukes the Nazis for their intended destruction of the moral code set down in the Ten Commandments, lending his famous irony and authorial license to this account of the shaping of the Jewish people.</p><p>Thomas Mann won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1929.

The aging, lonely and nostalgic narrator, a memory specialist, summons from the past the book's story within a story concerning his onetime acquaintance, Jewish refugee Harry Fonstein. Saved from the hands of the Nazis by an Italian underground movement spearheaded by Broadway showman Billy Rose, Fonstein immigrates to America, where he prospers--in business and in his marriage to an obese and brilliant woman. But his obsessive efforts to thank Rose are thwarted by the charismatic yet obnoxious, even deviant personality. Readers who yearn for more on the piquant WW II Bellarosa operation, or on the unsavory doings of Rose, are likewise frustrated by Bellow's characteristic philosophical digressions--savvy but ultimately self-indulgent--on Jewish assimilation in America, memory, friendship and aging: "I couldn't bring myself to go to bed just yet. One does grow weary of taking care of this man-sized doll, the elderly retiree, giving him his pills, pulling on his socks, spooning up his cornflakes, shaving his face, seeing to it that he gets his sleep." 125,000 first printing; $60,000 ad/promo. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Transformers: Rescue Bots: Meet Chase the Police-Bot (Passport to Reading)</h2><p>Optimus Prime has selected a special team of Transformers to work side-by-side with the people of Earth--they are called the Rescue Bots!

In fact, many people visit the park just see the cactus blossoms and the wildflowers. If you're one of them, this book will increase your enjoyment by helping you identify the wonders at your feet. And if you've never been to Big Bend when the cactuses are blooming, you'll discover here what you've been missing.</p> <p>Douglas B.

Color photographs taken by Doris Evans and Ro Wauer accompany the species descriptions. As you hike or drive through the park, you can identify most of the cactuses you see simply by leafing through these splendid pictures and then checking the descriptions, which indicate the cactuses' characteristic features and habitat.</p> <p>To make the book even more useful, Evans also briefly defines the parts of a cactus, explains how scientific names work, and offers a quick introduction to the geography and ecology of Big Bend National Park and the Chihuahuan Desert.

They left on 10 June, when Paris was declared an &#x2018;open city&#x2019;; taking with them many records and details of scientists who wished to continue their work in the UK. At Bordeaux staff at the British Embassy introduced them to the Master of a tramp steamer, one of 180 merchant ships standing by to evacuate troops and civilians in the three weeks after Dunkirk. Thirty three scientists were embarked, many with their immediate family. Two Belgians joined with a fortune in gem diamonds packed in two wooden crates. Two more French scientists boarded; bringing all of the &#x2018;heavy water&#x2019; (deuterium oxide &#x2013; a nuclear moderator) that then existed. Six hundred tons of machine tools were also loaded. The ship escaped from Bordeaux three days before the city fell and carried the passengers and cargo to safety at Falmouth, where there were ninety six other refugee ships. A special train took the passengers, and the most valuable items, to London. The diamonds were put into the vaults of a bank controlled by De Beers and most of the heavy water was stored beneath the library of Windsor Castle, with the Crown Jewels and with the King&#x2019;s knowledge. The House of Commons was only told of the &#x2018;Mission&#x2019; when in secret session; there was no publicity and no awards were made. The Earl, his secretary and their driver, formed a successful bomb disposal team. They lost their lives in May 1941, when their thirty fifth bomb detonated prematurely. The Earl was awarded the George Cross and his companions were &#x2018;Commended for Bravery.&#x2019; Much of the rescue was witnessed by a young naval lieutenant on his first overseas assignment. After the war he became an author and it is probable that the colourful characters involved in this mission first gave him the idea for one of the most famous fictional agents of the twentieth century. In 1943 Twentieth Century Fox wanted to make a film about &#x2018;The Incredible Earl of Suffolk&#x2019;, but were prevented from doing so by Lady Suffolk and the British government. Fox would have first heard of the story when a brief mention of the Earl's exploits appeared in press reports of his death. In 1973 the BBC made a four part series about him; they do not seem to have obtained copies of the official records, which were released at about that time. Much of the material for this book came from the British National Archives at Kew, near London; from the descendants of several of those involved and from researchers elsewhere in Europe.</p><p>The writer is a Master Mariner, he spent much of his working life in the marine salvage industry based in Southampton and Singapore.

A thriller of extraordinary depth and dimension, <i>Over Tumbled Graves </i>follows Caroline Mabry, a Spokane police detective searching for a serial murderer.</p></p><p>What is it about the Pacific Northwest that seems to attract mass murderers who prey on the most vulnerable of society's downtrodden? Had Spokane journalist Jess Walter made this tantalizing question the centerpiece of his debut thriller, he might have come up with something other than a relatively derivative retelling of an all-too-familiar plot. Instead, he takes the idea as well as the setting for his novel right from the 2000 headlines that trumpeted the arrest of serial killer Robert Yates for the murders of several young prostitutes in eastern Washington state. <p> Detective Caroline Mabry, still suffering the after-effects of a domestic violence incident that turned deadly, is assigned to investigate a killing spree that begins with the discovery of the mutilated body of first one and then several other prostitutes who were last seen on the stroll in a part of town apparently due for wholesale development. Partnered with her old flame Alan Dupree, a married detective whose sarcastic humor and iconoclastic ways are barely tolerated in the department, Caroline's investigation focuses on one Lenny Ryan, already sought in the seemingly unrelated murder of a young drug dealer. The two headline-grabbing FBI profilers brought into the case to help the beleaguered local police in their search for Ryan provide Walter with a subplot that slows down the narrative and adds little except a few cheap shots to the action. Mabry and Dupree will seem hauntingly familiar to readers of Ridley Pearson's popular cop thrillers starring Lou Boldt and Daphne Matthews. Yet Walter is a solid writer with a good command of his craft, and if serial killers are your style, <i>Over Tumbled Graves</i> won't disappoint. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>A Riverbank littered with bodies. A city under siege by crime-solving "experts." One young detective struggles to discover the truth ... and preserve her sanity.<p></p><p>Spokane, Washington: a bustling city split by hurtling white-water falls. During a routine drug bust, Detective Caroline Mabry finds herself on a narrow bridge over the falls, face-to-face with a brutal murderer named Lenny Ryan. Within hours, the body of a young prostitute is found nearby, dumped along the riverbank. Then another. And another. Soon Caroline and her cynical mentor Alan Dupree are thrown headlong into the search for a serial murderer police have nicknamed the Southbank Strangler. But while Caroline hunts a killer, he may also be hunting her.</p><p>What follows is a novel that turns the usual serial killer story on its head, that confronts America's burgeoning fascination with psychopathology and murder and stares it down. Through one long, bloody summer, Caroline and Dupree remain one step behind a madman who seems to be communicating by killing women and growing bolder with each new body. And when Spokane is overrun by headline-grabbing FBI profilers, statisticians, and TV producers, the detectives are forced to grapple with the ever hungrier serial murder industry. Before it's all over, Caroline and Dupree uncover some hard truths about their city, their profession, and each other. And Caroline finds herself back at the river, facing an evil far more alarming than the one she thought she was chasing.</p><p>Rich with the darkly muted colors of the Pacific Northwest skies, peopled with characters of extraordinary depth and dimension, <em>Over Tumbled Graves</em> marks the debut of a novelist with unusual insight into the human psyche.</p></p><h2>The Nebula Awards Showcase 2011 (Nebula Awards Showcase (Paperback))</h2><p><p>With this inaugural volume at Tor, the annual Nebula Award collection is reborn as a fiction-only anthology, edited by the incomparable Kevin J.

The poem consisted entirely of a single image&#x2014;an old man somewhere in the medieval Islamic world defying the narrow-minded by declaring his love for a hooved woman. Translating this image into a story, of course, introduced deeper demands in terms of plot and character. These demands eventually led to the story that appears here. Most of the characters&#x2019; names, by the way, are vaguely allegorical or otherwise playful&#x2014;&#x201c;Abdel Jameela,&#x201d; for instance, might be roughly translated as &#x201c;servant (or slave) of beauty.&#x201d;<br><br>As soon as I arrive in the village of Beit Zujaaj I begin to hear the mutters about Abdel Jameela, a strange old man supposedly unconnected to any of the local families. Two days into my stay the villagers fall over one another to share with me the rumors that Abdel Jameela is in fact distantly related to the esteemed Assad clan. By my third day in Beit Zujaaj, several of the Assads, omniscient as &#x201c;important&#x201d; families always are in these piles of cottages, have accosted me to deny the malicious whispers. No doubt they are worried about the bad impression such an association might make on me, favorite physicker of the Caliph&#x2019;s own son.<br>The latest denial comes from Hajjar al-Assad himself, the middle-aged head of the clan and the sort of half-literate lout that passes for a Shaykh in these parts. Desperate for the approval of the young courtier whom he no doubt privately condemns as an overschooled sodomite, bristle-bearded Shaykh Hajjar has cornered me in the village&#x2019;s only caf�&#x2014;if the sitting room of a qat-chewing old woman can be called a caf� by anyone other than bumpkins.<br>I should not be so hard on Beit Zujaaj and its bumpkins. But when I look at the gray rock-heap houses, the withered gray vegetable-yards, and the stuporous gray lives that fill this village, I want to weep for the lost color of Baghdad.<br>Instead I sit and listen to the Shaykh.<br>&#x201c;Abdel Jameela is not of Assad blood, O learned Professor. My grandfather took mercy, as God tells us we must, on the old man&#x2019;s mother. Seventy-and-some years ago she showed up in Beit Zujaaj, half-dead from traveling and big with child, telling tales&#x2014;God alone knows if they were true&#x2014;of her Assad-clan husband, supposedly slain by highwaymen. Abdel Jameela was birthed and raised here, but he has never been of this village.&#x201d; Shaykh Hajjar scowls. &#x201c;For decades now&#x2014;since I was a boy&#x2014;he has lived up on the hilltop rather than among us. More of a hermit than a villager. And&nbsp;<i>not</i>&nbsp;of Assad blood,&#x201d; he says again.<br>I stand up. I can take no more of the man&#x2019;s unctuous voice and, praise God, I don&#x2019;t have to.<br>&#x201c;Of course, O Shaykh, of course. I understand. Now, if you will excuse me?&#x201d;<br>Shaykh Hajjar blinks. He wishes to say more but doesn&#x2019;t dare. For I have come from the Caliph&#x2019;s court.<br>&#x201c;Yes, Professor. Peace be upon you.&#x201d; His voice is like a snuffed candle.<br>&#x201c;And upon you, peace.&#x201d; I head for the door as I speak.<br>The villagers would be less deferential if they knew of my current position at court&#x2014;or rather, lack of one. The Caliph has sent me to Beit Zujaaj as an insult. I am here as a reminder that the well-read young physicker with the clever wit and impressive skill, whose company the Commander of the Faithful&#x2019;s own bookish son enjoys, is worth less than the droppings of the Caliph&#x2019;s favorite falcon. At least when gold and a Persian noble&#x2019;s beautiful daughter are involved.<br>For God&#x2019;s viceroy the Caliph has seen fit to promise my Shireen to another, despite her love for me. Her husband-to-be is older than her father&#x2014;too ill, the last I heard, to even sign the marriage contract. But as soon as his palsied, liver-spotted hand is hale enough to raise a pen&nbsp;...<br>Things would have gone differently were I a wealthy man. Shireen&#x2019;s father would have heard my proposal happily enough if I&#x2019;d been able to provide the grand dowry he sought. The Caliph&#x2019;s son, fond of his brilliant physicker, even asked that Shireen be wedded to me. But the boy&#x2019;s fondness could only get me so far. The Commander of the Faithful saw no reason to impose a raggedy scholar of a son-in-law on the Persian when a rich old vulture would please the man more. I am, in the Caliph&#x2019;s eyes, an amusing companion to his son, but one whom the boy will lose like a doll once he grows to love killing and gold-getting more than learning. Certainly I am nothing worth upsetting Shireen&#x2019;s coin-crazed courtier father over.<br>For a man is not merely who he is, but what he has. Had I land or caravans I would be a different man&#x2014;the sort who could compete for Shireen&#x2019;s hand. But I have only books and instruments and a tiny inheritance, and thus that is all that I am. A man made of books and pittances would be a fool to protest when the Commander of the Faithful told him that his love would soon wed another.<br><i>I</i>&nbsp;am a fool.<br>My outburst in court did not quite cost me my head, but I was sent to Beit Zujaaj &#x201c;for a time, only, to minister to the villagers as a representative of Our beneficent concern for Our subjects.&#x201d; And my fiery, tree-climbing Shireen was locked away to await her half-dead suitor&#x2019;s recovery.<br>&#x201c;O Professor! Looks like you might get a chance to see Abdel Jameela for yourself!&#x201d; Just outside the caf�, the gravelly voice of Umm Hikma the caf�-keeper pierces the cool morning air and pulls me out of my reverie. I like old Umm Hikma, with her qat-chewer&#x2019;s irascibility and her blacksmithish arms. Beside her is a broad-shouldered man I don&#x2019;t know. He scuffs the dusty ground with his sandal and speaks to me in a worried stutter.<br>&#x201c;P-peace be upon you, O learned Professor. We haven&#x2019;t yet met. I&#x2019;m Yousef, the porter.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And upon you, peace, O Yousef. A pleasure to meet you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The pleasure&#x2019;s mine, O Professor. But I am here on behalf of another. To bring you a message. From Abdel Jameela.&#x201d;<br>For the first time since arriving in Beit Zujaaj, I am surprised. &#x201c;A message? For me?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, Professor. I am just returned from the old hermit&#x2019;s hovel, a half-day&#x2019;s walk from here, on the hilltop. Five, six times a year I bring things to Abdel Jameela, you see. In exchange he gives a few coins, praise God.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And where does he get these coins, up there on the hill?&#x201d; Shaykh Hajjar&#x2019;s voice spits out the words from the caf� doorway behind me. I glare and he falls silent.<br>I turn back to the porter. &#x201c;What message do you bear, O Yousef? And how does this graybeard know of me?&#x201d;<br>Broad-shouldered Yousef looks terrified. The power of the court. &#x201c;Forgive me, O learned Professor! Abdel Jameela asked what news from the village and I&nbsp;... I told him that a court physicker was in Beit Zujaaj. He grew excited and told me beg upon his behalf for your aid. He said his wife was horribly ill. He fears she will lose her legs, and perhaps her life.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;His wife?&#x201d; I&#x2019;ve never heard of a married hermit.<br>Umm Hikma raises her charcoaled eyebrows, chews her qat, and says nothing.<br>Shaykh Hajjar is more vocal. &#x201c;No one save God knows where she came from, or how many years she&#x2019;s been up there. The people have had glimpses only. She doesn&#x2019;t wear the head scarf that our women wear. She is wrapped all in black cloth from head to toe and mesh-masked like a foreigner. She has spoken to no one. Do you know, O Professor, what the old rascal said to me years ago when I asked why his wife never comes down to the village? He said, &#x2018;She is very religious&#x2019;! The old dog! Where is it written that a woman can&#x2019;t speak to other women? Other women who are good Muslims? The old son of a whore! What should his wife fear here? The truth of the matter is&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The truth, O Shaykh, is that in this village only&nbsp;<i>your</i>&nbsp;poor wife need live in fear!&#x201d; Umm Hikma lets out a rockslide chuckle and gives me a conspiratorial wink. Before the Shaykh can sputter out his offended reply, I turn to Yousef again.<br>&#x201c;On this visit, did you see Abdel Jameela&#x2019;s wife?&#x201d; If he can describe the sick woman, I may be able to make some guesses about her condition. But the porter frowns.<br>&#x201c;He does not ask me into his home, O Professor. No one has been asked into his home for thirty years.&#x201d;<br>Except for the gifted young physicker from the Caliph&#x2019;s court. Well, it may prove more interesting than what I&#x2019;ve seen of Beit Zujaaj thus far. I do have a fondness for hermits. Or, rather, for the&nbsp;<i>idea</i>&nbsp;of hermits. I can&#x2019;t say that I have ever met one. But as a student I always fantasized that I would one day&nbsp;<i>be</i>&nbsp;a hermit, alone with God and my many books in the barren hills.<br>That was before I met Shireen.<br>&#x201c;There is one thing more,&#x201d; Yousef says, his broad face looking even more nervous. &#x201c;He asked that you come alone.&#x201d;<br>My heartbeat quickens, though there is no good reason for fear. Surely this is just an old hater-of-men&#x2019;s surly whim. A physicker deals with such temperamental oddities as often as maladies of the liver or lungs. Still&nbsp;... &#x201c;Why does he ask this?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He says that his wife is very modest and that in her state the frightening presence of men might worsen her illness.&#x201d;<br>Shaykh Hajjar erupts at this. &#x201c;Bah! Illness! More likely they&#x2019;ve done something shameful they don&#x2019;t want the village to know of. Almighty God forbid, maybe they&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>Whatever malicious thing the Shaykh is going to say...</p><h2>Hauntings</h2><p>This fiendish anthology, complied by the horror genre&#x2019;s most acclaimed editor, drags you into the twisted minds of modern literary masters at their fiendish best.

She was the fiction editor of <i>OMNI</i> from 1981&#x2013;1998 and has since edited the online magazines <i>Event Horizon</i> and <i>Sci Fiction</i>. Her many anthologies include <i>Naked City</i>; <i>Snow White, Blood Red</i>; <i>Blood and Other Cravings</i>; and <i>Poe</i>. Datlow has won five Hugo Awards, eight Locus Awards, three Bram Stoker Awards, two Shirley Jackson Awards, and nine World Fantasy Awards.This anthology of 24 previously published dark fantasy and horror stories, edited by the ever-adept Datlow (<i>Blood and Other Cravings</i>), explores a variety of situations in which people encounter literal or figurative specters from beyond. Some feature the ghosts of lovers or spouses wronged, while others give readers a powerful lens through which to view the evil people can do here on Earth, as in the gut-wrenching Cargo&#x2019; by E. Michael Lewis. The theme is interpreted quite loosely and in varied ways, although many of the stories such as the atmospheric opener, Pat Cadigan&#x2019;s Eenie, Meenie, Ipsateenie,&#x2019; and Adam L. G. Nevill&#x2019;s tense Where Angels Come In&#x2019; hinge on anxieties relating to children in peril. Even so, the collection flows smoothly, capturing the pleasantly shivery dread of a round of ghost stories told by a fire, with only a few hiccups or sour notes (the most sour being Richard Bowes&#x2019;s deeply unpleasant Transfigured Night&#x201d;). Solid entries by Neil Gaiman, Caitl�n R. Kiernan, and Joyce Carol Oates capture the mood perfectly and will thrill fans of the eerie.&#x201d;<br> <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br> [<i>Hauntings</i> is] apt to entertain and disquiet the horror fans.&#x201d;<br> <i>SF Site, featured review</i><br><br> Datlow once again proves herself as a master editor. Her mission to broaden readers&#x2019; concepts of what a haunting can be is nothing short of a success, and the twenty-four stories on display run the gamut from explicitly terrifying to eerily familiar. Readers who wish to be haunted themselves should not miss this one.

Far less well-documented are the entrenched systems and beliefs that shape punishment and other official forms of social control today. <br><br>In<i> Race, Gender, and Punishment</i>, Mary Bosworth and Jeanne Flavin bring together twelve original essays by prominent scholars to examine not only the discrimination that is evident, but also the structural and cultural forces that have influenced and continue to perpetuate the current situation. Contributors point to four major factors that have impacted public sentiment and criminal justice policy: colonialism, slavery, immigration, and globalization. In doing so they reveal how practices of punishment not only need particular ideas about race to exist, but they also legitimate them. <br><br>The essays unearth troubling evidence that testifies to the nation's brutally racist past, and to white Americans' continued fear of and suspicion about racial and ethnic minorities. The legacy of slavery on punishment is considered, but also subjects that have received far less attention such as how colonizers' notions of cultural superiority shaped penal practices, the criminalization of reproductive rights, the link between citizenship and punishment, and the global export of crime control strategies. <br><br>Uncomfortable but necessary reading, this book provides an original critique of why and how the criminal justice system has emerged as such a racist institution.</p><p>Mary Bosworth is University Lecturer in criminology and fellow of St. Cross College at the University of Oxford.

In a little over a century it rose from a mere frontier outpost to become one of the great cities of the world. No single book can possibly encompass the immense scope of this development or convey the endless diversity of the life of Chicago's people. But with the help of the camera it is possible to capture many dimensions of this extraordinary story.<br><br>This volume, however, which comprises over 1,000 pictures and 50 maps, tries to do more than show physical development&#x2014;it attempts to suggest how the city expanded and why it looks the way it does. Because it asks different questions, this book differs markedly from other "pictorial histories" of American cities. Instead of emphasizing society and customs, this volume deals with the physical conditions of life. In place of the conventional interest in "founding fathers" and leading families, it is more concerned with street scenes and ordinary people. Without neglecting downtown, it also reaches into the residential areas and neighborhood shopping centers. Moreover, this volume is concerned with suburbs and "satellite" towns as well as the historic city.<br><br>"<i>Chicago: Growth of a Metropolis</i> is an incredible book. Like its subject it is excessive, and nothing succeeds like excess. It is handsomely designed, with a thousand photographs that document the physical growth and the spatial patterns of the city. . . . A dimensionalism comes through that no other city has. Carl Sandburg sang it in his poetry, and the book does more to grasp it . . . than any other book I have seen."&#x2014;Hugh Newell Jacobson, <i>New Republic</i></p><p></p><h2>The origin of stencil duplicating,</h2><p>&#34;THE ORIGIN OF STENCIL DUPLICATING is the only documented and authoritative history devoted to this subject. Briefly mentioning the first uses of copying devices in the Babylonian era, Mr. Proudfoot traces a truly fascinating story up to and including the revolutionary years of 1875 to 1905. During the early part of this period stencils were considered in various forms but only emerged as a practical process in 1881. This process was perfected in 1888, subsequently extended to a stencil for use on the typewriter and thus revolutionized long-established office procedures. The copying methods in use in the eighteenth-century and Victorian office prior to that brief but active period of innovation are described and discussed in the first part of this book. The story of the growth of stencil duplicating and the struggles of its pioneers are told in three subsequent parts: Handwriting Stencils, Typewriting Stencils, and Rotary Duplicators in which the technical evolution of the process and its practice is traced. In crediting the inventors and assessing the commercial progress of stencil duplicating it is inevitable that the rise of the House of Gestetner and its founder David Gestetner should emerge as a central part of the story. ABOUT THE AUTHOR: W.B. Proudfoot was born and educated in Dundee. After extensive studies in pharmacy and chemistry he became a lecturer at Dundee Technical College, but moved to London in 1944 to join a research team doing war work on reclaiming rubber at Gestetner Limited, Tottenham. After the war he remained with the firm and was subsequently involved in Gestetner&#39;s industrial research and development on stencil duplicating and related products. He was later appointed Head of Research, an appointment he retained up to his retirement in 1970.</p><p></p><h2>Eleventh Grade Burns</h2><p>Things have taken a darker turn for the half-human teenager with an appetite for blood. Joss, a vampire slayer and Vlad&#x2019;s former friend, has moved back to Bathory. A mysterious and powerful new vampire, Dorian, appears with a shocking secret and an overwhelming desire to drink Vlad&#x2019;s blood. And Vlad&#x2019;s arch enemy, D&#x2019;Ablo, has a sinister plan to eliminate Vlad once and for all. With death threatening from every angle, Vlad will have to use every ounce of his skill and training to survive, but nothing can prepare him for what awaits him in the end. <br><br>Watch a Video<p> </p></p><p>Heather Brewer was not your typical teen growing up. She wore black, danced under full moons, and devoured every book in sight. She hasn't changed much.

He lunged forward but the slayer skillfully dodged his blow, delivering a hard roundhouse kick to the creature&#x2019;s throat. The vampire fell to the ground, coughing, choking on its own blood. The slayer could have killed the beast a half hour ago. But this wasn&#x2019;t just about ridding the world of another abomination (though that was definitely the end goal). It was about a slayer needing to release some pent-up hostility and cleanse himself of all of his clouded thoughts.</p><p>Thoughts that were now perfectly clear.</p><p>These bloodsucking <i>things</i> could not be trusted. Not even when they donned the mask of a relatively normal teenager. Not even when they claimed to be your friend. Especially when they used their insidious powers to gain your trust and get you to reveal secrets that even those closest to you didn&#x2019;t know. Especially when their name was Vladimir Tod.</p><p>Joss was done playing games. With Vlad&#x2019;s face planted firmly in the forefront of his imagination, he slipped the silver-tipped wooden stake from his backpack and approached the vampire on the ground with an eager step. He whispered, &#x201c;For you, Cecile,&#x201d; and thrust the stake forward, before the beast could draw a single breath. Blood&#x2014;hot, slick, so deep red that it seemed black in the light of the moon&#x2014;poured out over his hands. The nameless vampire fell still.</p><p>Joss straightened his shoulders, triumphant.</p><p>From his backpack, he withdrew a cell phone and hit number two on speed dial. When the voice at the other end answered, he said, &#x201c;This is Joss. I need a cleanup on the ocean side of Russian Gulch State Park. The target is secure. Am I cleared to move on to my next objective?&#x201d;</p><p>When the voice on the other end answered in the affirmative, Joss hung up the phone. There was no need to continue the conversation.

When it fell, he picked it up and did it again, counting. Thirty-six times it had fallen Slayer Society up. Twenty-two times it was down. He spun the coin again, but before it had a chance to fall a hand came down on it from across the table. Henry looked at his best friend, his eyebrows drawn together in concern. Vlad sat back, a dark cloud hanging over him. &#x201c;When?&#x201d;</p><p>Henry plucked the coin up in his hand and turned it over, frowning. &#x201c;Next week.&#x201d;</p><p>Vlad watched the coin, rereading the inscription on one side: FOR THE GOOD OF MANKIND &#x201c;How long have you known?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As soon as my mom told me I came straight over to tell you.&#x201d; Henry dropped the coin and ran a hand through his hair, groaning. &#x201c;What are we going to do?&#x201d;</p><p>The coin rolled across the table and off the edge. Vlad&#x2019;s hand moved so quickly that Henry couldn&#x2019;t even see it. He returned the coin to the table and once again spun it on the table&#x2019;s surface, returning to his former silence.</p><p>&#x201c;We have to do something, Vlad. You can&#x2019;t just sit here spinning that stupid coin and waiting for Joss to come finish the job. Now that your invincibility is gone . . .&#x201d;</p><p>Vlad spun the coin again, harder this time. Henry was right. They had to do something. Henry&#x2019;s cousin Joss was moving back to Bathory, this time with his family, and Vlad bet that it wasn&#x2019;t due to coincidence or the fact that Henry&#x2019;s family lived here. Joss was coming to kill him. And ever since D&#x2019;Ablo&#x2019;s stupid ritual last year, he was very much in danger of dying.</p><p>But Vlad couldn&#x2019;t think about a solution. All he&#x2019;d been able to think about since the Freedom Fest was Meredith, and how much he wished they could be together. But they couldn&#x2019;t. He was too much of a danger to her. So he&#x2019;d broken her heart and, in turn, shattered his own to pieces. He was empty. He was alone.</p><p>And now he was in danger of dying at the hand of a slayer, his former friend.</p><p>He spun the coin again. Henry picked it up and threw it across the room. It clattered on the floor behind Vlad. &#x201c;Do something!&#x201d;</p><p>Vlad looked at him somberly. &#x201c;Like what?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Anything. You act like Joss coming back to town is no big deal. I know you&#x2019;re still all torn up about Meredith . . .&#x201d; Vlad shot him a warning glance, but Henry wasn&#x2019;t about to back down. &#x201c;What? You&#x2019;ve been like this all summer, but you did what you had to do. Now you act like you don&#x2019;t care if Joss comes back here and sticks another stake through your heart.&#x201d; Henry&#x2019;s eyes shined in frustration. &#x201c;But I do.&#x201d;</p><p>His words hung in the air between them, weakening Vlad&#x2019;s resolve.</p><p>Henry turned and walked to the other side of the kitchen, reaching up to wipe his eyes on his sleeve, trying to keep it hidden from his friend. &#x201c;Look, man, I don&#x2019;t want to get all chick-flick on you or anything, but you&#x2019;re my best friend and I almost lost you last time. I can&#x2019;t go through that again. I won&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>Vlad sighed, saying everything with his eyes that he couldn&#x2019;t bear to with his voice. He couldn&#x2019;t do anything. Short of killing Joss&#x2014;Henry&#x2019;s cousin, Vlad&#x2019;s former friend&#x2014;he couldn&#x2019;t do anything at all. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right. I just don&#x2019;t see how I can stop him without . . .&#x201d; He didn&#x2019;t have to say it, and neither of them wanted him to. He couldn&#x2019;t kill Joss. That just wasn&#x2019;t an option.</p><p>&#x201c;What about mind control?&#x201d;</p><p>Vlad frowned. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t control him for the rest of his life, Henry. Besides, sooner or later, my concentration would break.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There has to be something . . .&#x201d; Henry returned to his seat, a look of desperation washing over his features. &#x201c;What about Otis? He&#x2019;s like a million years old.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Three hundred and two.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Whatever, he&#x2019;s old. He&#x2019;s dealt with slayers his whole life, I bet. You should ask him what to do.&#x201d;</p><p>After a moment, Vlad nodded thoughtfully. If anyone would know what to do, his uncle would.</p><p>Henry nodded too, looking somewhat relieved that Vlad was actually going to take action. &#x201c;Anyway, I&#x2019;d better get back. My mom is on a cleaning rampage because of our extended family moving to town. If I&#x2019;m not there, who knows what she&#x2019;ll throw out! The woman has no respect for the treasures of an adolescent male.&#x201d;</p><p>Henry stood and glanced at Vlad, a worrisome expression on his face. &#x201c;You sure you&#x2019;re okay?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah. I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201d; Vlad forced a smile, and Henry walked out the front door, closing it behind him.</p><p>As soon as the latch clicked, Vlad reached down and retrieved the coin. A deep line creased his forehead as he read the inscription over again. He focused on Otis and spoke with his thoughts. <i>&#x201c;Otis? I need to talk to you. I could use some advice.&#x201d;</i></p><i><p>&#x201c;Just let me finish up my meeting with Principal Snelgrove and I&#x2019;ll be home shortly, Vladimir.&#x201d;</p></i><p> A pause, then Otis&#x2019;s voice once again in his mind. <i>&#x201c;Is everything all right?&#x201d;</i></p><p>Vlad turned the coin over in his hand. An image flashed in his mind. A small point of silver at the center of his chest. And blood. Lots of blood. Vlad shook his head, willing the memory away. <i>&#x201c;No. But it can wait until you get home. Just . . . hurry, okay?&#x201d;</i></p><p>Otis grew quiet for a moment, then said, <i>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be there shortly.&#x201d;</i></p><p>Vlad gripped the coin in his hand and leaned forward, pressing his forehead to the tabletop. He fought, but the memories burst through his dam of resistance. Joss&#x2019;s eyes narrowing at the sight of Vlad&#x2019;s glowing mark. The bitter accusations of betrayal. A whisper: <i>&#x201c;For you, Cecile.&#x201d; </i> The feeling of being punched in the back. Looking down and seeing the silver tip of the wooden stake. He&#x2019;d coughed, and the pain had dragged him under.</p><p>Afterward, when Joss had visited him in the hospital, Vlad had been almost certain he&#x2019;d apologize. But he didn&#x2019;t. Instead, he told Vlad that he was leaving. Their friendship, it seemed, was over. No longer friends, they were more than enemies. They were natural foes&#x2014;vampire and slayer.</p><p>And Vlad still wasn&#x2019;t sure how he felt about it.</p><p>The staking incident had been horrific to endure. And recovering from it had been no picnic. But the worst part of it was that he missed Joss, missed his company, his insight, his impossibly dorky way of looking at the world. When Joss had slammed that hunk of wood through Vlad&#x2019;s chest, Vlad had survived . . . but their friendship had not. And he was still mourning it, still grieving over the loss of a very good friend.</p><p>Not to mention the reason Joss was returning.</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t need to hear it from Joss&#x2019;s lips. The note he&#x2019;d left on Vlad&#x2019;s locker before he skipped town freshman year had said it all: <i>Friendship over.</i></p><p>And if it really was over, then Vlad was going to have to formulate a plan pretty quickly on how to face Joss the slayer, rather than Joss the friend.</p><p>He sat up, gripping the coin tightly, and watched the door for Otis&#x2019;s return. After many minutes, the door swung open, and his uncle entered.</p><p>Otis immediately met his eyes. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d;</p><p>Vlad sat the coin on the table in plain view. &#x201c;How&#x2019;d the interview go?&#x201d;</p><p>Otis furrowed his brow with a questioning in his eyes. &#x201c;It went well. I&#x2019;ll be teaching mythology full time at the high school.&#x201d; He paused for a moment and wet his lips. &#x201c;Is everything all right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Congrats on the job. A lot of students have missed you since eighth grade&#x2014;they&#x2019;ll be happy to have you back. Me too.&#x201d; Vlad dropped his attention to the slayer coin and released a tense sigh. &#x201c;I have a problem, Otis. Joss is moving back to Bathory.&#x201d;</p><p>Otis closed his eyes for a moment and sighed, visibly relaxing. He took a seat opposite Vlad with a small smile affixed to his lips. &#x201c;You had me worried for a second.&#x201d;</p><p>Vlad&#x2019;s eyebrows drew together in confusion. Clearly Otis had lost his mind. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not worried anymore?&#x201d;</p><p>Otis shook his head. The bemused expression on his face irritated Vlad, though he wasn&#x2019;t sure why. &#x201c;Vladimir, there are far worse things than a slayer who&#x2019;s out for blood. Besides, if he steps out of line and threatens you at all, he&#x2019;ll be easily dispatched. Especially with two, soon to be three, vampires living here in Bathory.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Dispatched?&#x201d; Vlad blinked, dropping his gaze momentarily to the coin on the table between them. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to kill him.&#x201d;</p><p>Otis seemed perplexed by this. He grew quiet, obviously mulling over something in his mind. Finally, he nodded and said, &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re more comfortable with it, I&#x2019;d be happy to&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re missing the point.&#x201d; Vlad&#x2019;s jaw tightened defensively. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want anything to happen to Joss. I don&#x2019;t want you to touch him or hurt him in any way. He&#x2019;s . . . my friend.&#x201d;</p><p>For a long time Otis didn&#x2019;t speak. Neither did Vlad. He was too busy trying to figure out how the conversation had gone so quickly from asking for advice to killing his friend.</p><p>After a while, Otis leaned forward, tension and disbelief ebbing from him. &#x201c;We are speaking of the same boy who drove a stake through your chest from behind, in the most cowardly way possible, yes? And you want to, what, give him an opportunity to finish the job?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then the matter must be dealt with.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But he&#x2019;s my friend, or at least he was. I don&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;ll try anything like that again.&#x201d; It surprised Vlad how easily the lie slipped from his lips. Maybe it shouldn&#x2019;t have. He&#x2019;d been doing a lot of it lately. Pushing the image of Snow from his mind, he met Otis&#x2019;s gaze.</p><p>Otis furrowed his brow. &#x201c;Fine. If Joss keeps his distance, I&#x2019;ll leave him be. But so help him if he threatens or harms you again.&#x201d;</p><p>Vlad shook his head. &#x201c;Then I&#x2019;ll deal with him. I don&#x2019;t want him hurt.&#x201d;</p><p>The corner of Otis&#x2019;s mouth twitched slightly. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve made that abundantly clear. So what <i>do</i> you want?&#x201d;</p><p>The thing was that he had no real idea of what he wanted. The only thing he could think of was for time to spin backward, for Joss to have never become a slayer in the first place. And that wasn&#x2019;t exactly an option.</p><p>Vlad sighed. &#x201c;Your advice. I want to know how to make a slayer back off without killing him.&#x201d;</p><p>Otis sat back, shaking his head. &#x201c;To tell you the truth, I don&#x2019;t know if anyone&#x2019;s ever tried. As far as I&#x2019;ve seen, you can&#x2019;t. Once a slayer has his mark, he will stop at nothing until the task has been completed. It&#x2019;s always just been easier to take them out of the picture altogether.&#x201d;</p><p>His voice took on a disgusted tone and rose as he continued. &#x201c;They call it that&#x2014;a task. Did your <i>friend</i> mention that? I suppose it must make taking the life of a person easier to refer to the act as a <i>task</i> instead of <i>murder</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>He threw his arms up, disgusted and angry and acting very much like Vlad wasn&#x2019;t on his side. &#x201c;Just as referring to vampires as <i>things</i> and <i>monsters</i> must make it easier to stomach the idea of killing <i>people</i> who happen to have fangs.&#x201d;Vlad watched him, wide-eyed, slumping back in his seat. &#x201c;Why do you sound so angry?&#x201d;</p><p>Otis stood suddenly, and slapped his palms on the table, his eyes fierce. &#x201c;Because I am! How can you defend him, Vladimir? How can you spare his life when he nearly took yours? He&#x2019;s nothing, just a slayer, a foolish assassin armed with a wooden stake. They are the ones who declared war on us, and we have every right to defend ourselves when we know an attack is about to happen. That&#x2019;s all Joss is, Vlad, another casualty of war. He just doesn&#x2019;t know it yet.&#x201d;</p><p>Otis sat down in the chair opposite Vlad, his eyes seething. &#x201c;If you ask me, the world would be a better place without him and his kind walking around, free to do as they please.&#x201d;</p><p>Vlad shook his head wordlessly. When he spoke, it was in near-whispers. &#x201c;Listen to yourself, Otis. You&#x2019;re grouping them all together and plotting their extinction. You sound just like they do. Maybe you&#x2019;re not all that different.&#x201d;</p><p>Otis clenched his jaw and pointed a stern finger at his nephew. He stood abruptly, pushing the chair sharply back from the table. Vlad instantly knew that he had gone too far, but he didn&#x2019;t care. He braced himself for the words that were soon to come flying out of his uncle&#x2019;s mouth. Hateful words. Words filled with venom and justification.</p><p>But the words didn&#x2019;t come. Otis turned and walked out of the kitchen. When the front door slammed, Vlad winced, but only slightly.</p><p>The coin lay on the tabletop where he&#x2019;d left it. Plucking it up in his hand, he spun it once more, and wondered if Joss had noticed its absence, or if he had any idea where it might be now. It had to be his, after all. There were no other slayers in Bathory. It had to be Joss&#x2019;s coin. Maybe that&#x2019;s why Vlad had kept it. Maybe that&#x2019;s why he couldn&#x2019;t stop looking at it.</p></p><h2>Yoga For Life: How to Stay Strong, Flexible and Balanced Over 40</h2><p>Yoga for Life is aimed specifically at anyone over 40 looking for a yoga practice suited to mid-life and beyond.

Half a century later, the wreck of the Andrea Doria is still claiming lives. <br>Professional and amateur divers the world round consider the Andrea Doria to be the Everest of diving. At 225 feet below the surface, the wreck lies at the very edge of human endurance and accomplishment; ordinary air becomes toxic and the divers who go there suffer nitrogen narcosis or "the rapture of the deep." Symptoms include confusion, lack of coordination, and perhaps most deadly of all, a loss of the ability to make clear decisions. As a result, divers use Trimix, an exotic blend of oxygen, nitrogen, and helium to descend through the strong currents, rusted metal, and twisted wires to the ultimate symbol of deep sea diving accomplishments: china teacups and plates from the wreck of the Andrea Doria. For serious wreck divers, these fragile artifacts are genuine proof of their abilities as divers.<br>During the summers of 1998 and 1999, three elite divers lost their lives, all on separate dives from the top dive boat out of Montauk, the 65-foot Seeker. Craig Sicola was clearly suffering from "china fever" before he went down. He'd handled teacups brought up by veteran Doria diver Gary Gentile, and the gleam in Craig's eye was unmistakable. Craig dove on June 24, 1998. A few hours later, his body bobbed to the surface. He was carrying a plate. <br>Joe Haberstroh, the award-winning Newsday reporter, watched events unfold during the summers of 1998 and 1999. In this remarkable and intriguing book he recreates what was the pride of the Italian fleet, how it sank, the dangers of the deep, and the gripping personal stories of the men who live or die for a teacup from its remains.<br></p><p>Joe Haberstroh is the "On the Waters" columnist for Long Island's Newsday. In 1997, he won a Pulitzer Prize for coverage of the crash of TWA flight 800. <br>"A gripping true story of treasure hunting and tragedy on the <i>Doria,</i> the world's most dangerous shipwreck."--<i>Daily News</i><br><br>"Should be required reading for all divers."--<i>Immersed</i><br><br>"Well researched, well interviewed, and written without frills.

As a result, Michael Ann Holly maintains, art historians today do not have access to the full range of methodological considerations and possibilities that Panofsky's thought offers, and they often remain unaware of the significant role art history played in the development of modern humanistic thought. </p><p>Placing Panofsky's theoretical work first in the context of the major historical paradigms generated by Hegel, Burckhardt, and Dilthey, Holly shows how these paradigms themselves became the grounds for creative controversy among Panofsky's predecessors&#x2015;Riegl, W�lfflin, Warburg, and Dvor�k, among others. She also discusses how Panofsky's struggle with the terms and concepts of neo-Kantianism produced in his work remarkable parallels with the philosophy of Ernst Cassirer. Finally, she evaluates Panofsky's better known and later "iconological" studies by reading them against the earlier essays and by comparing his earlier ideas with the vision that has inspired recent work in the philosophy of history, semiotics, and the philosophy of science.</p></p><p><p>Michael Ann Holly is Director of the Research and Academic Program at the Clark Art Institute and teaches in the graduate program at Williams College.

That means he'll be here in time for tea. Well, I do call that nice!'</p> <p>No answer being made to this remark, the lady at the head of the table repeated it, adding: &#x2018;I'm sure you'll like him. He's such a gentleman, if you know what I mean.'</p> <p>Miss Cliffe raised her eyes from her own correspondence. &#x2018;Sorry, Aunt Ermyntrude: I wasn't attending. The Prince oh yes! Then the big car will be wanted to meet the train. I'll see to it.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Yes, do, dearie.' Mrs Carter restored the Prince's letter to its envelope, and stretched out a plump arm towards the toast-rack. She was a large woman, who had enjoyed, in youth, the advantages of golden hair and a pink-and-white complexion. Time had committed some ravages with both these adjuncts, but a lavish use of peroxide and the productions of a famous beauty specialist really worked wonders. If the gold of Ermyntrude's carefully waved hair was a trifle metallic, the colour in her cheeks was all and more than it had ever been. Artificial light was kinder to her than the daylight, but she never allowed this tiresome fact to worry her, applying her rouge each morning with a lavish yet skilled hand which recalled the days when she had adorned the front row of the chorus; and touching up her lashes with mascara, or (in her more dashing moments) with a species of vivid blue that was supposed to deepen the perfectly natural blue of her eyes.</p> <p>The exigencies of this facial toilet apparently exhausted her matutinal energy, for she never put on her corsets until fortified by breakfast, and invariably appeared in the dining-room in a robe of silk and lace which she referred to as her n�glig�. Mary Cliffe, who had never been able to accustom herself to the sight of Ermyntrude's flowing sleeves trailing negligently across the butter-dishes, and occasionally, if Ermyntrude were more than usually careless, dipping into her coffee, had once suggested, with perfect tact, that she really ought to stay in bed for breakfast. But Ermyntrude was of a cheerful and a sociable disposition, and liked to preside over the breakfast-table, and to discover what were her family's plans for the day.</p> <p>Mary Cliffe, who addressed her by the title of aunt, was not, in fact, her niece, but the cousin, and ward, of her husband, Wallis Carter. She was a good-looking young woman in the early twenties, with a great deal of common sense, and a tidiness of mind which years of association with Wally Carter had only served to strengthen. She was fond of Wally, in a mild way, but she was not in the least blind to his faults, and had not suffered even a small pang of jealousy when, five years before, he had, rather surprisingly, married Ermyntrude Fanshawe. The possession of a small but securely tied-up income of her own had ensured her education at a respectable boarding-school, but her holidays, owing to Wally's nomadic tendencies and frequent insolvencies, had been spent in a succession of dingy boarding-houses, and enlivened only by the calls of creditors, and the recurrent dread that Wally would succumb to the attractions of one or other of his landladies. When, during a brief period of comparative affluence, he had patronised a large hotel at a fashionable watering-place, and had had the luck to captivate Ermyntrude Fanshawe, who was an extremely rich widow, Mary, with her customary good sense, had regarded his marriage as providential. Ermyntrude was undoubtedly flamboyant, and very often vulgar, but she was good-natured, and extremely generous, and so far from resenting the existence of her husband's young ward, behaved to her with the utmost kindness, and would not hear of her leaving Wally's roof to earn her own living. If Mary wanted to work, she said, she could act as her secretary at Palings, and perhaps help with the housekeeping. &#x2018;Besides, dearie, you'll be a real nice companion for my Vicky,' she added.</p> <p>This had seemed to Mary to be a fair arrangement, although, when she met Vicky Fanshawe, a precocious schoolgirl, five years her junior, she could not feel that they were destined to become soul-mates.</p> <p>Vicky, however, was being educated, at immense expense, first at a fashionable school on the south coast of England, and later at a still more fashionable finishing-school in Switzerland. During the last two years, she had spent her holidays abroad with Ermyntrude, so that Mary had hardly encountered her. Her education was now considered to be completed, and she was living at home, a source of pride and joy to her mother, but not precisely an ideal companion for Mary, who was alternately amused and exasperated by her.</p> <p>She reflected, on this warm September morning, that the presence of a Russian prince in the house would be productive of all Vicky's most tiresome antics, and inquired in tones of foreboding whether the Prince were young.</p> <p>&#x2018;Well, I wouldn't say young,' replied Ermyntrude, helping herself to marmalade. &#x2018;He's at what I call the right age, if you know what I mean. You never saw anyone so distinguished and then his manners! Well, you don't meet with such polish in England, not that I'm one to run down my own country, but there it is.'</p> <p>&#x2018;I don't like Russians much,' said Mary perversely. &#x2018;They always seem to talk so much and do so little.'</p> <p>&#x2018;You shouldn't be narrow-minded, dear. Besides, he isn't actually a Russian, as I've told you a dozen times. He's a Georgian he used to have a lovely estate in the Caucasus, which is somewhere near the Black Sea, I believe.'</p> <p>At this moment the door opened, and Wally Carter came into the room. He was a medium-sized man, who had been good-looking in youth, but who had run rather badly to seed. His blue eyes were inclined to be bloodshot, and his mouth, under a drooping moustache, sagged a little. In the days when he had courted Ermyntrude, his fondness for strong liquor had not made him quite careless of appearances, but five years spent in opulent circumstances had caused him to deteriorate lamentably. He was naturally slovenly, and his clothes never seemed to fit him, nor his hair to be properly brushed. He was generally amiable, but grumbled a good deal, not in any bad-tempered spirit, but in a gently complaining way to which none of his family paid the slightest heed.</p> <p>&#x2018;Here you are, then!' said his wife, by way of greeting. &#x2018;Touch the bell, Mary, there's a love! We couldn't have had a better day, could we, Wally? Though, of course, as I always say, to see Palings at its best you ought to see it when the rhododendrons are out.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Who wants to see it?' inquired Wally, casting a lack-lustre glance towards the window.</p> <p>&#x2018;Now, Wally! As though you didn't know as well as I do that the Prince is coming today!'</p> <p>This reminder seemed to set the seal to Wally's dissatisfaction. He lowered the newspaper behind which he had entrenched himself. &#x2018;Not that fellow you picked up at Antibes?' he said.</p> <p>A spark of anger gleamed in Ermyntrude's eye. &#x2018;I don't see that you've any call to be vulgar. I should hope I didn't go picking up men at my time of life! Alexis was introduced to me by Lady Fisher, I'll have you know.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Alexis!' ejaculated Wally. &#x2018;You needn't think I'm going to go about calling the fellow by a silly name like that, because I'm not.'</p> <p>&#x2018;You'll call him Prince Varasashvili, and that's all there is to it,' said Ermyntrude tartly.</p> <p>&#x2018;Well, I won't. For one thing, I don't like it, and for another, I couldn't remember it not that I want to, because I don't. And if you take my advice, you'll be careful how you say it. If you start introducing this fellow as Prince Varasash whatever-it-is, you'll have people saying you've been mixing your drinks.'</p> <p>&#x2018;I must say it's a bit of a tongue-twister,' remarked Mary. &#x2018;You'll have to write it down for me, Aunt Ermy.'</p> <p>&#x2018;It'll be quite all right if you just call him Prince,' said Ermyntrude kindly.</p> <p>&#x2018;Well, if that's your idea of quite all right it isn't mine,' said Wally. &#x2018;Nice fool you'll look when you say Prince, and find the poor old dog wagging his tail at you.'</p> <p>This aspect of the situation struck Ermyntrude most forcibly. &#x2018;I hadn't thought of that,' she admitted. &#x2018;I must say, it does make things a bit awkward. I mean, you know what Prince is! It would be awful if I went and said, "Get off that chair, Prince," as I don't doubt I will do, thanks to the way you spoil that dog, Wally, and Alexis thought I was speaking to him. Oh well, Prince will have to be tied up, that's all.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Now, that's one thing I won't put up with,' said Wally. &#x2018;It's little enough I ever ask, but have my poor old dog tied up for the sake of a Russian prince I don't know and don't want to know, I won't. If you'd asked me before inviting the fellow, I should have said don't, because I don't like foreigners; but, as usual, no one consulted me.'</p> <p>Ermyntrude looked concerned. &#x2018;Well, I'm sorry you're so set against Alexis, Wally, but honestly he doesn't speak foreign.'</p> <p>Wally paid not the slightest heed to this, but said: &#x2018;A set of wasters, that's what those White Russians are. I'm not surprised they had a revolution. Serves them right! What was this chap of yours doing at Antibes? You needn't tell me! Living on some rich woman, that's what he was doing!' He found that his ward had raised her eyes quickly to his face, and was flushing rather uncomfortably, and added: &#x2018;Yes, I know what you're thinking, but I shall be a wealthy man one of these days, so the cases aren't the same. When my Aunt Clara dies, I shall pay Ermyntrude back every penny.'</p> <p>Mary made no remark. Wally's Aunt Clara, who had been an inmate for the past ten years of a Home for Mentally Deficients, was well known to her by repute, having served Wally as an excuse for his various extravagances ever since she could remember.</p> <p>Ermyntrude gave a chuckle. &#x2018;Yes, we all know about this precious Aunt Clara of yours, dearie. All I can say is, I hope you may get her money, not that there's any question of paying back between us, because there isn't; and if you're trying to cast it up at me that I grudge you anything, you know I don't grudge a penny, except for what you squander on things which we won't mention.'</p> <p>This sinister reference, accompanied as it was by a rising note in his wife's voice, quelled Wally. He hastily passed his cup to her for more coffee, and greeted, with frank relief, the sudden and tempestuous entrance of his stepdaughter.</p> <p>This damsel came into the room on a wave of dogs. Two cocker spaniels, Ermyntrude's Pekinese, and an overgrown Borzoi cavorted about her, and since one of the cockers had apparently been in the river, a strong aroma of dog at once pervaded the room.</p> <p>&#x2018;The Sports Girl!' remarked Mary, casting an experienced eye over Vicky's costume.</p> <p>This consisted of a pair of slacks, an Aertex shirt, and sandals which displayed two rows of reddened toe-nails.</p> <p>&#x2018;Oh, darling, not the spaniels! Oh, if Prince hasn't been in the water again!' exclaimed Ermyntrude distressfully.</p> <p>&#x2018;Poor sweets!' Vicky crooned, ejecting them from the room. &#x2018;Lovely, lovely pets, not now! Lie down, Roy! Good Roy, lie down!'</p> <p>&#x2018;What's this idea of bringing a pack of dogs in to breakfast?' demanded Wally, repulsing the advances of the Borzoi. &#x2018;Lie down, will you? You might as well try to eat in a damned menagerie!' He added, after a glance at Vicky's costume: &#x2018;What's more, it puts me off my food to see you in that get-up. I don't know why your mother allows it.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Oh, let her alone, Wally!' said Ermyntrude. &#x2018;I'm sure she looks as pretty as paint, whatever she wears. Not but what I don't care for trousers myself. Time and again when I've seen some fat creature waddling about in them, I've thought to myself, well, my girl, if you could see your own bottom you'd soon change into a skirt.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Darling! I practically haven't got a bottom!' protested Vicky, sliding into her place opposite to Mary.</p> <p>&#x2018;Nor you have, ducky. That's one way you don't take after me!'</p> <p>Vicky smiled abstractedly, and began to read her letters, while her mother sat surveying her with fond admiration.</p> <p>She was indeed a very pretty girl, with pale corn-coloured hair, which she wore rather long, and curled into a thick bush of ringlets at the base of her neck; and large blue eyes that gazed innocently forth from between darkened lashes. Even the ruthless plucking of her eyebrows, and the pencilling of improbable arches perceptibly higher than the shadows of the original brows, failed to ruin her beauty. Her complexion varied in accordance with her mood, or her costume, but she had no need of powder to whiten a naturally fair skin.</p> <p>&#x2018;I suppose you know about this prince coming to stay?' said Wally, in a grumbling tone. &#x2018;What your mother wants with him I don't know, though I dare say you're as bad as she is, and think there's something fine about having a prince in the house.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Oh, I think it's lovely!' Vicky said.</p> <p>This artless response disgusted Wally so much that he relapsed into silence.</p> <p>Ermyntrude had slit open another letter, and suddenly exclaimed &#x2018;Ah!' in an exultant tone. A triumphant smile curled her lips. &#x2018;There's nothing like a prince!' she said simply. &#x2018;The Derings have accepted!'</p> <p>Even Wally seemed pleased by this announcement, but he said, with a glance in Mary's direction, that he didn't think the Prince had anything to do with it. &#x2018;I wouldn't mind betting young Bering's home,' he said.</p> <p>Mary coloured, but replied calmly: &#x2018;I told you he was, yesterday.'</p> <p>Vicky emerged from the clouds of some apparently beatific dream to inquire: &#x2018;Who is he?'</p> <p>&#x2018;He's an old friend of Mary's,' said Wally.</p> <p>&#x2018;The boy-friend?' asked Vicky, interested.</p> <p>&#x2018;No, not the boy-friend,' said Mary. &#x2018;His people live at the Manor, and I've known him ever since we came to live here. He's a Chancery barrister. You must remember him, surely!'</p> <p>&#x2018;No, but he sounds frightfully dull,' said Vicky.</p> <p>&#x2018;Well, he's a very nice young fellow,' said Wally. &#x2018;And if he wants to marry Mary I shall make no objection. No objection at all. What's more, I shall leave her all my money.'</p> <p>&#x2018;When you get it,' said Ermyntrude, with a chuckle. &#x2018;I'm sure I hope he will ask Mary to marry him, because it would be what I call a good match, and what's more, the man that gets you, my dear, will be very lucky, whatever his people may say.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Thank you!' said Mary. &#x2018;But as he hasn't asked me to marry him, I don't think we need worry about what his people would say, Aunt Ermy.' Conscious of her heightened colour, she made haste to change the subject, looking across the table at Vicky, and saying: &#x2018;By the way, what got you out of bed so bright and early this morning? I heard you carolling in the bath at an ungodly hour.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Oh, I went out to see if I could get a rabbit!'</p> <p>Mary's lips twitched. &#x2018;I thought this was a Sports-Girl Day! Don't tell me you weren't wearing sandals and painted toe-nails, because it would spoil the whole picture for me!'</p> <p>&#x2018;But I was!' said Vicky, opening her eyes very wide.</p> <p>&#x2018;You must have looked a treat!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Yes, I do think I looked rather nice,' Vicky agreed wholeheartedly.</p> <p>&#x2018;Did you shoot anything?'</p> <p>&#x2018;Oh yes, very nearly!'</p> <p>&#x2018;That's where you take after your father, ducky,' said Ermyntrude. &#x2018;I never knew such a man for sport! Three times he went to Africa, big-game shooting. That was before he met me, of course.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Well, if you call missing rabbits taking after her father, I don't,' remarked Wally. &#x2018;As far as I can make out, her father never missed anything. It's a great pity he didn't, if you ask me, for if he had perhaps I shouldn't have had to live in a house full of bits of wild animals.

He felt that achieving purity by avoiding meat and refraining from committing harm further promoted the pursuit of a peaceful life. Elements of the worship of Dionysus, such as shape-shifting and ritualistic ecstasy, were fused with Orphic beliefs to produce a powerful and illuminating new religion that found expression in the mystery cults. Practitioners of this new religion composed a great body of poetry, much of which is translated in <i>The Orphic Hymns</i>.</p><p>The hymns presented in this book were anonymously composed somewhere in Asia Minor, most likely in the middle of the third century AD. At this turbulent time, the Hellenic past was fighting for its survival, while the new Christian faith was spreading everywhere. <i>The Orphic Hymns</i> thus reflect a pious spirituality in the form of traditional literary conventions. The hymns themselves are devoted to specific divinities as well as to cosmic elements. Prefaced with offerings, strings of epithets invoke the various attributes of the divinity and prayers ask for peace and health to the initiate. Apostolos N. Athanassakis and Benjamin M. Wolkow have produced an accurate and elegant translation accompanied by rich commentary.</p></p><p><p>The only English translation of the mysterious and cosmic Greek poetry known as the Orphic Hymns.</p><p><b>Apostolos N.

The Horror!</i> uncovers a rare treasury of some of the most important and neglected stories in American literature&#x2014;the pre-Code horror comics of the 1950s. These outrageous comic book images, censored by Congress in an infamous televised U.S. Senate subcommittee investigating juvenile delinquency in 1954, have rarely been seen since they were first published&#x2014;and are revealed once again in all of their eye-popping glory. Jim Trombetta, in his commentary and informative text, provides a detailed history and context for these stories and their creators, spinning a tale of horror and government censorship as scary as the stories themselves.<br><br>Bonus DVD--<i>Confidential File</i>, a rare 25-minute TV show that first aired on October 9, 1955, about the "evils" of comic books and their effect on juvenile delinquency is included with the book.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Please note that the enclosed DVD begins with a 58-second test pattern, followed by the tv show.&nbsp;<br><br></b>Praise for <i>The Horror!

Trombetta documents the phenomenon, reprinting more than 100 covers, dozens of excerpts, and a handful of complete stories that amply demonstrate the imaginatively gruesome tales that shocked a nation but captivated millions of readers. Since his aim is to accurately characterize the genre, most of Trombetta&#x2019;s examples sport crude artwork, preposterous plots, and risible dialogue. However, several rise above the mediocrity: while EC Comics&#x2014;the artistically preeminent publisher of the decade&#x2014;is represented only in passing, complete stories by such auteurs as the celebrated Basil Wolverton and the underappreciated Howard Nostrand are included. Trombetta strings together the selections with perceptive commentary that assesses the comics&#x2019; recurring elements&#x2014;not just zombies and werewolves, but also such themes as hunger and sexual hostility&#x2014;and ties them into such cultural and political currents of the era as anticommunism, nuclear terror, and racism.

Dower doesn't reach this disturbing conclusion lightly. He combed through piles of propaganda films, news articles, military documents, cartoons--even entries in academic journals in researching this book.

(general fiction).</p><p><p><strong>Picked by the Amazon editors as the #1 book of 2015:</strong> Many a therapist will tell you that honesty and transparency is the glue that keeps a relationship together. Lauren Groff cleverly turns this concept on its head in <em>Fates and Furies</em>, demonstrating that sometimes it&#x2019;s what you don&#x2019;t say&#x2014;to protect your partner&#x2019;s vanity, their reputation, their heart&#x2014;that makes a marriage hum. (Until it doesn&#x2019;t.) Broken up into two parts and numerous perspectives, this dazzlingly told tale of one such marriage introduces us to Lotto and Mathilde. The former is an out-of-work actor-turned successful playwright, although some of that success is fueled by forces his ego obscures. And then there&#x2019;s his adoring and enigmatic wife, Mathilde, who we later find out is a far better actor than Lotto ever was. For all the smoke and mirrors, Groff crafts a convincing love story that packs an emotional punch, especially when certain truths are revealed. There is also something satisfying in finding out the extent to which our own perceptions are skewed as the narrative unfolds. The title <em>Fates and Furies</em> is a nod to Greek Tragedy, and this novel revels in the themes befitting one&#x2014;passion, betrayal, vengeance, redemption...You will revel in it, too. <em>&#x2013;Erin Kodicek</em></p>Lauren Groff is the &#34;New York Times &#34;bestselling author of two novels, &#34;The Monsters of Templeton&#34; and &#34;Arcadia,&#34; as well as the celebrated short-story collection &#34;Delicate Edible Birds.&#34; She graduated from Amherst College and has an MFA in fiction from the University of Wisconsin Madison.

In the fractured first section, Saterstrom introduces Abella and her daughter, Azalea, in staccato, spare sentences; the moments described feel crucial but ransacked, since Saterstrom leaves large spaces between words that may have swallowed integral bits of information. Abella, "a woman [who] enjoyed socializing and thinking about restoration projects," is married to the abusive, alcoholic policeman Micajah. His beatings and likely sexual abuse (never fully revealed but strongly suggested) take their toll on their daughter, Azalea; she turns to the bottle and marries Willie, a lawyer distressingly like her father who later becomes a district judge. In section two, succinctly titled passages like "Vitamins," "Bracelets" and "Hitchhiker" convey in taut, unaffected language the horror Willie and Azalea's four daughters witness throughout their childhood. The girls narrowly survive their violent upbringing and have children themselves. Aza, who repeatedly attempted suicide as a child, begets the unnamed narrator of section four whose spooked but sensitive voice steers the book through some of its richest, most devastating passages. Brutal but also deeply lyrical, Saterstrom's beautiful novel paints a portrait of a family wracked by its own dysfunction and held fast by a place that has never fully recovered since the day the Civil War began�&#x20ac;"the day known, as the book tellingly reminds us, as "Ruination Day."<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Using long-lost stories and interviews with survivors, Greene has reconstructed the drama of their struggle to stay alive<br></p><p>On October 23, 1958, gases from deep within the earth shot skyward, causing entire floors of rock to rise instantly in a coal mine in Springhill, Nova Scotia, trapping 174 men underground. Seventy-five miners never made it out alive. Miraculously, two small groups of miners survived the initial "bump" but were sealed in small caverns deep within the coal. Surrounded by foul air and total darkness, and with precious little food and water, the men vacillated between optimism and hopelessness as they tried to maintain sanity amidst horrific conditions. Above them, fellow miners and rescue workers dug desperately to get them out, clinging to the unwritten Miner's Code that no man shall be left behind. After a week of digging and with hope all but exhausted, they found one group of a dozen miners; a day later seven more men were discovered. Melissa Fay Greene describes this harrowing ordeal in sharp detail, effectively capturing the drama of the event for both the miners trapped below and their distraught families waiting above. <p> Placing the event into a larger context, Greene describes how it became the first nationally televised disaster, as journalists from all over Canada and the U.S. converged on the small town and camped at the entrance of the mine. After their rescue, the men were the center of media attention, and some of them became instant celebrities (one was chosen as Canada's "Citizen of the Year"; another became a spokesman for 7-Up soda). She also details the bizarre episode in which an assistant to the governor of Georgia tried to spin the disaster into a marketing gimmick to promote tourism. To the segregationist governor's chagrin, one of the rescued miners turned out to be black, presenting him with a potential public relations nightmare. Though her use of fictionalized dialogue between the miners is sometimes distracting, Greene's extensive research brings this remarkable story to life, making <i>Last Man Out</i> an absorbing re-creation of a forgotten episode. <i>--Shawn Carkonen</i></p>Trapped a mile below the earth&#x2019;s surface, with scant hope of rescue, nineteen miners spent over a week without light, drink, food.

Having shared the experience, a sympathetic reader cannot help but marvel at the absurdity of the disaster's aftermath. This is a fine, harrowing, brutally detailed work that will make you savor daylight in a way you never have&#x2014;unless of course you're already a coal miner."<br>--Erik Larsen, author of <i>Isaac's Storm</i><br><br>Praise for <i>Praying for Sheetrock</i><br>"A monumental social history with implications that go far beyond the borders of a tiny coastal Georgia county.

It focuses on the attitudes Germans have had toward their art from the Romantic period to the present and discusses the ways they have tried to find their identity as a nation through this art.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>The Inner City Mother Goose</h2><p>Poems inspired by traditional nursery rhymes depict the grim reality of inner city life, including such topics as crime, drug abuse, unemployment, and inadequate housing.</p><p>Gr. 9^-12. Anyone who thinks that "inner city" and "Mother Goose" are incompatible hasn't read a good collection of the rhymes to a child at bedtime and wondered, "Maybe I should skip this one . . ." These traditional rhymes have been violent from the beginning, and their origins often lay in social commentary. <i>The Inner City Mother Goose</i> makes no pretense of appealing to children. Someday, perhaps, the rhymes' biting, ironic commentary will be so far removed from reality that they become nonsense, but that day seems no closer than it was 27 years ago when the first edition of <i>The Inner City Mother Goose</i> was published as an adult book. The 1970 <i>Booklist</i> review called its verse "lacerating little rhymes, worlds removed in mood and content from the traditional Mother Goose poems." Most of the verses were illustrated with striking, gritty black-and-white photographs.<p>Now published as a young adult book, the new edition includes a number of poems written after the first. It also omits several from the original book. Acrylic paintings by Caldecott-winner David Diaz illustrate 10 of the verses. Although the more sophisticated art in the first edition may actually have greater appeal to young adults, Diaz's small, intense paintings create portraits rich in composition, color, and gesture. The images, almost mythic in their sense of representing more than individual people, seem to move with the rhythm of the verse.</p><p>No matter which illustrations the reader prefers, the power is in the poetry. As in any collection, some of the poems are better than others. As in any parody, knowledge of the original adds greatly to a reading of the verses. Still, the poems come together, uneven but undeniably powerful. They make their statements in different ways, with different tones, all contributing to a chorus that comes through loud and clear. When they first appeared, these poems sounded modern in spite of their nursery rhyme inspiration. They still do.</p><p>Merriam's introduction to the second edition (1982) is reprinted here. In it, Merriam comments that the book became "just about the most banned book in the country," with most of the criticism centering on one vulgar word, though broadening into more general charges that seemed to confuse cause and effect. Some of the poems concern aspects of our society, such as violence, racism, and corruption, that most of us prefer to leave in darkness. Instead, the poetry occasionally flashes like summer lightning, suddenly illuminating what we would rather not see and exposing our fears in its swift, cold light.</p><p>Whatever its history, and wherever librarians choose to shelve it, this book belongs in libraries: not because it mimics Mother Goose, not because it stirs controversy, but because it speaks with such clarity and in such an unexpected form. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i></p>Grade 7 Up?Once upon a time?in 1969?the prolific, insightful Merriam penned these prophetically painful words. Fortunately for readers, they are still available. Unhappily ever after, however, they still ring disarmingly true. Originally written as a form of social and political commentary, the book was reprinted in 1982 and greeted with much controversy. The words are hard, honest, and, at times, harsh. The poetry is given fresh and updated verve with bold, multicultural illustrations by Diaz and an introduction by Nikki Giovanni. The Inner City Mother Goose travels to the place many fear to tread?and records the anger, agony, and angst present in everyday life. Unemployment, housing woes, drugs, violence, corruption, and neglect are presented in solid, rhythmic lines like "Now I lay me down to sleep/ I pray the double lock will keep," and "There was a crooked man,/ And he did very well." If Merriam thought her lines were appropriate in 1969, she would be saddened to know of their expanded meaning today. Giovanni's introduction leaves readers with perhaps the best reason to read and reread these lines?

O'Brien traces the feline family back to early <i>Proailurus</i> (30 to 20 million years ago), mentions a number of species, and includes some non-feline predators with saberlike canines. Realistic watercolor and gouache illustrations lend eye-catching glamour to the captionlike text, showing <i>Smilodon</i>'s skeletal makeup and making life-size comparisons of teeth from a sabertooth, a modern tiger, and a modern human. Other contemporary predators are illustrated as well, along with a picture gallery of possible prey. While some recent research seems to indicate a measure of dental "fragility" limiting bite pressure, O'Brien opts for the cat's "huge teeth" as "perfect for biting through the thick, hairy hide of big beasts, such as mammoths and buffalo."

Throughout the book, Kornbluh-a director of the National Security Archive, a nonprofit research library-buttresses his assertions with excerpts from the relevant documents, and attempts to shed light on some of the outstanding questions of the period that still beg for answers, including what motivated President Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger to authorize the bloody campaign and how involved the US government actually was in the September 1973 coup itself. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Lear Collection a Study of Copper Alloy Socket Candlesticks A.D.200-A.D.1700</h2><p>, 398 pages, photographs throughout including some in colour</p><p></p><h2>Arc D&#39;X</h2><p>Thomas Jefferson&#39;s love for and enslavement of his mistress, Sally Hemings, forms the center of an exploration of the American spirit. By the author of Days Between Stations. 50,000 first printing. National ad/promo. Author tour.</p><p>A bold and occasionally brilliant interpretation of American history--but marred by a too obvious cerebration that numbs, turning original ideas into mere conceits. Appropriating the rumored liaison between Thomas Jefferson and the slave Sally Hemings, Erickson (Tours of the Black Clock, 1989, etc.) makes that relationship not only a recurring event in the following centuries but uses it as a metaphor for a conflict between the heart and history. For Erickson, this relationship personifies Jefferson's inability to separate history--the need to further human freedom--from the ``pursuit of happiness''--the needs of his heart. This, the novel suggests, is the same conflict that has also shaped America's destiny. And beginning with Jefferson's childhood memory of a slave burned at the stake and ending as the millennium threatens cataclysmic disaster, this conflict is repeatedly reenacted and dissected. In settings that include revolutionary Paris; a sinister city-state ruled by the Primacy; and a millennial Berlin abandoned by most of its inhabitants, characters resembling the original lovers repeat their first encounter. There's a rape that becomes a lasting but flawed love reminding Jefferson of his dereliction of ideals, and Sally of her connivance in her continued enslavement. All encounters, whether in the Fleurs d'X, a bar in the red-light area of the Primacy, or in a deserted Berlin hotel are explorations of the intersection--the arc of x--between ``history's denial of the human heart,'' on the one hand, and, ``on the other, history's secret pursuit of the heart's expression.'' Which makes for relentless intellectualizing and even more constrained characters as America and the lovers never quite resolve their destructive contradictions, and the ``pursuit of happiness'' remains ``the most forbidden artifact of all.'' Much fine writing and many provocative ideas, but nothing connects--ever--even at the many proffered intersections. Clever but cold. (First serial to Esquire) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Erickson, who has attracted a strong following with his three novels (the most recent was Tours of the Black Clock ) and the memoir Leap Year , has now written his most provocative novel yet, an apocalyptic narrative in which he yokes his grim vision of America to the exalted vision of Thomas Jefferson. The story opens in Paris, where Jefferson is serving as the new country's ambassador to France. The protagonist, however, is not the master of Monticello but Sally Hemings, the slave and concubine he has brought with him. A beautiful young woman with "skin that was too white to be quite black and too black to be quite white," Sally accepts her submission to Thomas, even as she makes him promise to free their children; for him, their relationship embodies all that is paradoxical in the new nation, as "it was the nature of American freedom that he was only free to take pleasure in something he possessed." Their bastard child, so to speak, is America, and soon enough the novel leaps forward two centuries, at least, to a dystopian Los Angeles that represents America at its most wayward. There the spirits of Sally and Thomas are made manifest through any number of characters, as well as through a talismanic stone and cryptic references to "the pursuit of happiness." Dark, chaotic, ruled by religious zealots and policed by Chandleresque lone gunmen, Erickson's dystopia is rather too familiarly rendered; and too often his prose simply disorients the reader when he means to explore the nature of disorientation. But he has written an undeniably prodigious work--its disjunct sentences opening up new worlds of expectation, its grave and agonized obsessions standing out in stark contrast to the lucid principles Jefferson set down in the Declaration of Independence.

In his account, Baxter describes skirmishes and cavalry charges outside his front door, the &#x201c;firing&#x201d; of his town&#x2019;s buildings during a Confederate retreat, clashes between secessionist and Unionist neighbors, the feeding of hungry soldiers and the forceful appropriation of his remaining food supply, and the sickening sight of the wounded emerging from the Prairie Grove battlefield.</p><p>Since its original printing, this firsthand account has only been reprinted once, in 1957, and both editions are considered collectors&#x2019; items today. Of interest to Civil War scholars and general readers alike, Baxter&#x2019;s compelling social history is rendered even more comprehensive by William Shea&#x2019;s introduction. <i>Pea Ridge and Prairie Grove</i> is a valuable personal account of the Civil War in the Trans-Mississippi West which enables us to better comprehend the conflict as a whole and its devastating effect on the general populace of the war-torn portions of the country.</p></p><p>William Baxter was the president of Arkansas College and a clergyman in Fayetteville, Arkansas, when the Civil War started in 1861. William L. Shea is a professor of history at the University of Arkansas at Monticello and coauthor of Pea Ridge: Civil War Campaign in the West (1992, University of North Carolina Press)."Baxter's Pea Ridge and Prairie Grove should help readers understand the human dimension of the Civil War. His story is not about the strategy of generals and the movement of armies on maps, but rather about the destructive power of warfare." &#x2015;Bobby Roberts Director, Central Arkansas Library System<br><br>&#x201c;This book is a window into a time and place, from a point of view too often neglected. Baxter&#x2019;s account, flawed as it is, has value for scholars today. Baxter describes the human side of war, what happens to people who have no idea what will come next and are powerless to alter events. ... <i>Pea Ridge and Prairie Grove</i> makes an excellent addition to the &#x201c;Civil War in the West&#x201d; series and anyone interested in civilian life and the Trans-Mississippi will want to examine this short work.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;<i>The Civil War News</i></p><h2>Mars (Bantam Spectra Book)</h2><p>Chosen to replace an original crew member, native American geologist Jamie Waterman joins the historic mission to Mars, enduring grueling months of training and, ultimately, the extraordinary adventure that follows.</p><p>The Bookcassette� format is a special recording technique developed as a means of condensing the full, unabridged audio text of a book to record it on fewer tapes.

The ancient art of the pendulum, now called Radiesthesia, or Psionic healing, opens many new fields of research, and when learned correctly can be an invaluable source of self-help. The proper use of the pendulum can determine many conditions in the body which no other tests will show, for example, the amount of pollution caused by our environment. The pendulum can guide one to lessen or eliminate states of imbalance, using natural, herbal or homeopathic remedies. With Radiesthesia the pendulist can determine the need for vitamins, minerals, and supplements on a daily basis; also which remedies and dosage to use when ill. <p>Through the author's psychic investigations into the conditions of the etheric body, she has developed new methods of using the pendulum. Insights into the principles of healing are pointed out in diagrams and shared. In this course she teaches the meaning, potential, and varied uses of color healing. Also included is how to test and treat each of the chakras, or nerve centers, for balancing the vital energy flow. The pendulist can measure predispositions, thereby having a unique tool to maintain a state of health. The mysterious art of "Broadcasting" healing remedies is also gone into very thoroughly. This course is both for the beginner, the professional healer, and anyone who is interested in broadening their understanding of healing, and the use of the pendulum.</p></p><p>Gabriele Blackburn is a spiritual healer and clairvoyant. She has worked with doctors, psychologists and scientists, which together with her psychic investigations has enabled her to bring out many unique facets concerning the healing of the psychological and physical aspects of man. She always approaches her work in a creative way, which leads to many new discoveries in the area she terms, "Holistic Spiritual Healing." <p>Gabriele Blackburn has taught Radiesthesia and Healing seminars in the United States, Canada, New Zealand, and Europe to many health interested groups.

Sir Frank Kermode, Britain&#39;s most distinguished literary critic, has been thinking about them all his life. This book is a distillation of that lifetime&#39;s thinking. The great English tragedies were all written in the first decade of the seventeenth century. They are often in language that is difficult to us, and must have been hard even for contemporaries. How and why did Shakespeare&#39;s language develop as it did? Kermode argues that the resources of English underwent major change around 1600. The originality of Kermodes&#39;s writing, and the intelligence of his discussion, make this book a landmark.</p><p>Frank Kermode has been Lord Northcliffe Professor of Modern English at University College London, King Edward VII Professor of English Literature at Cambridge, and Charles Eliot Norton Professor of Poetry at Harvard.

She was shortlisted for the Orange Prize for Fiction, Britain's most prestigious literary award.In 1890, a 24-year-old African-American and Southern Presbyterian missionary named William Sheppard left New York for the Congo. During the next 20 years, Sheppard explored that country and in the process discovered a lake that now bears his name; made the first meaningful Western contact with the Kuba kingdom, one of the last native African dynasties, and failed in his attempt to create a "utopia of African-American achievement in Africa." He also clashed with the Belgian colonial authorities, exposing their brutal, genocidal treatment of Africans and, as a result, found himself at the center of a charged, internationally monitored trial in which the powerful performance of lawyer Emile Vandervelde, the leader of the Belgian Socialist Party, overcame a claim that Sheppard had slandered the foremost Belgian producer of rubber. Kennedy (The Exes), a novelist, is captivated by her charismatic subject charisma evidenced by Sheppard's enduring presence in the oral histories of the Kuba and, like the novelist she is, offers fully developed portraits of others in Sheppard's orbit as well. She speculates with a modern feminist's perspective about the inner life of Sheppard's wife, Lucy, who saw two of her children die in Africa, and she examines the reactions to Sheppard of white missionaries, who were unable to succeed in the native culture as well as he. Kennedy also explores the irony of Sheppard, who was made a Kuba prince, facing segregation and discrimination at home. Kennedy is an engaging writer and ably captures the undercurrent of horror found everywhere in the late 19th-century Congo while honoring Sheppard's accomplishments, heroism and character.

Little George needs a father's guidance. For their children's sake, Cole Matheson and Mercy Jacobs agree on a businesslike marriage.

She has written over thirty books, many of them set in the fictitious town of Dry Creek, Montana where the men spend the winters gathered around the potbellied stove in the hardware store and the women make jelly in the fall.<i>Montana Territory <br>December 20, 1886</i><br><br>The steel <i>clickety-clack</i> of the rails slowed as the town of Miles City came into sight. Mercy Jacobs felt her heart catch. Being a mailorder bride was nerve-racking. With every mile and every stop on the route, her new home of Angel Falls came closer and closer.<br><br>And so did the reality of meeting the stranger she'd agreed to marry.<br><br>"Ma?" Her seven-year-old son fidgeted on the seat beside her, straining to see above the lip of the win-dowsill to get a better view of the approaching town. "Will Angel Falls be like this one?"<br><br>"I don't know, George. Maybe." She smiled past her nervousness. Cole Matheson, the man whose advertisement she'd answered, had written of a friendly railroad town lined with shops, one of which was his own.<br><br>"Will it be snowy, too?" Those wide baby-blue eyes filled with a child's hope.<br><br>"I reckon so, as your new pa said in his last letter to bundle up, that our first Christmas in Montana Territory was guaranteed to be white."<br><br>"Boy, I sure do wanna go out and play in that." George sighed wistfully. As the train chugged a little slower, the view of snowy fields, rolling hills and the snow-mantled roofs of homes clustered along the outskirts of town became crisp, no longer blurred. Easy to soak in and dream a little. George let out a sigh of longing that fogged part of the window. He swiped it away with one hand and watched two children building a snowman in their backyard.<br><br>Snow had been hard to come by at their home in North Carolina.<br><br>"Miles City, next stop!" The conductor's voice carried above the conversations of passengers in the crowded car, packed with folks traveling to be with family for the holiday.<br><br>"Well, that's me." Maeve Flanagan turned around in her seat to smile back at Mercy. The small child seated beside her peered out the window, too. "This is as far as we go."<br><br>"Are you nervous? You look nervous. Why, you're absolutely pale." Mercy leaned forward and caught her new friend's hand. They'd met back East when Maeve had boarded the train, a mailorder bride, too. "Take a deep breath."<br><br>"I'm fine. It's merely last-minute butterflies." Maeve smiled gently. She was truly striking at nearly six feet tall with beautiful red hair and blue-green eyes. "This is what I've been waiting for this entire journey. Meeting Mr. Noah Miller."<br><br>"He'll be everything you've been hoping for, I just know it." Mercy gave Maeve's gloved had a squeeze of encouragement. "Our prayers will be answered."<br><br>"We've prayed so often on this trip, surely the Good Lord has heard us." Maeve paused as the train's brakes squealed, making conversation difficult.<br><br>The train jerked to a stop, bouncing them in their seats. With the final jerk, all motion ceased. Her time with Maeve had come to an end, but she knew regardless of where their separate paths led them, they would always be friends. Some journeys bound hearts together, and this was one of them.<br><br>"Why, it's my two mailorder brides." The conductor, kindly Mr. Blake, paused in the aisle with a sympathetic smile on his round face. He might be a big man and built like on ox, but his heart was bigger. "I've been praying for you lovely ladies. Think of the happiness awaiting you. Why, I can't imagine a thing more romantic. It's almost like a story, first declaring love with each other through your letters and then finding a deeper love when you meet. It must be all poetry and declarations of the heart, like a fairy tale happening just to you. Not only am I a happily married man, so I know what's waiting for you, but it's the Christmas season. Love and happy endings are in the air."<br><br>"That's very kind of you," Maeve said gently, as if she wasn't so sure.<br><br>Mercy was even less sure. Love was not the reason she had traveled across the country to wed a stranger. She managed a weak smile.<br><br>Mr. Blake was not derailed easily. He pulled something from his pockets. He held up two sprigs of handsome green leaves bearing small white berries. A tiny bow of thin velvet ribbon added a festive touch. He grinned widely. "Think of this gift as a wish and a prayer for your happy marriages. For your first kisses on Christmas Day with your new husbands."<br><br>"It's mistletoe!" Maeve exclaimed, surprised.<br><br>"Oh, thank you." Mercy accepted hers, touched by his thoughtfulness. She wished to say more but he'd already touched his hand to his cap and moved on to help an elderly lady with her valise at the end of the car.<br><br>"Bless you, Mr. Blake." Maeve quickly pinned her spray of mistletoe to her collar. "I appreciate the thoughtful wish."<br><br>"And you'll have mine, too." Mercy gave Maeve a brief hug. "My prayers for you won't cease."<br><br>"Nor will mine for you." With that, Maeve grabbed her young daughter's hand. Little four-year-old Violet was adorable with her dark auburn hair, cherub's face and violet-blue eyes. She looked up at her mother expectantly. Maeve appeared grim as she stepped into the aisle. "Be happy, my friend."<br><br>"You, too." She knew how Maeve felt&#x2014;hollow, knowing that Mr. Blake's wishes for them could not come true. A business arrangement did not a real marriage make. She hugged Maeve and said goodbye to Violet, and they were gone, traipsing down the aisle.<br><br><i>Lord, please grant her happiness in her new marriage,</i> Mercy prayed. <i>Somehow.</i><br><br>Her stomach clenched as she settled back into her seat. Soon, it would be her turn to step off the train and meet the man she'd agreed to bind her life to. She smoothed George's flyaway blond hair with her hand. That cowlick always stuck straight up, regardless of what she did. Love for her boy filled her heart.<br><br>He was the reason she'd accepted this mailorder situation. Regardless of the type of man Cole Mathe-son turned out to be, if he was a good father to her son, she would be content. She would endure any disappointments silently and be grateful for a convenient marriage, one without love.<br><br>* * *<br><br>"Hurry, Pa! We'll be late for the train." Amelia's voice echoed through the dry-goods store, rising above the rustle and din of Christmas customers filling the aisles. The tap of her impatient gait struck like a hammer in uneven raps through the store as she skirted knots of customers and arrowed straight for him. "You promised, Pa. You said you'd keep an eye on the time."<br><br>"It's been a busy day." Cole Matheson looked over the top of his reading spectacles, pausing in tallying up Mrs. Lanna Wolf's purchases. He frowned at his daughter. "I haven't heard the train whistle. It's not time yet."<br><br>"It's four o'clock." The thirteen-year-old skidded to a stop in front of the counter, her apple cheeks pink from running, her strawberry-blond hair threatening to escape her braids, strands tumbling loose to curl around her face. She looked as if she'd been playing outside with the boys again, with chunks of snow melting in her hair and her blue flannel dress wet in spots. She gestured toward the clock on the wall. "The train's late and so are you. C'mon, we've got to hurry."<br><br>"I have to finish helping Mrs. Wolf," he said sternly, for all the good it did. Amelia was used to his ways and wasn't troubled by them. "Now politely apologize to Mrs. Wolf."<br><br>"I'm sorry, ma'am." Amelia bobbed in a quick curtsy. "But my new mother is coming on the train today, and Pa isn't nearly as excited about it as I am."<br><br>"Why, this is wonderful news. I hadn't heard." Lanna Wolf smiled gracefully, apparently not troubled by the child's behavior. "Congratulations to you both. What a happy thing to have happen right before Christmas."<br><br>"It's my Christmas present," Amelia was quick to explain. "It's the only gift I've asked for every Christmas for three Christmases in a row, and this year I finally wore Pa down. All I had to do was mention how I needed a ma on account of one day soon I'll be needing a corset, and that did it. It changed his mind on the spot."<br><br>"I suppose it would." Lanna laughed, seemingly unaware he'd turned two shades brighter than a beet.<br><br>"And she's really nice. I read every one of her letters and even wrote her two. She answered them both. I think she'll be a really good ma." Amelia released a dramatic, satisfied sigh. "It'll be the best Christmas present ever."<br><br>For his daughter, at least. Cole slipped his glasses higher on his nose and squinted at the column of figures. He doubled-checked his addition and gave Mrs. Wolf her total.<br><br>"Just add it to my account, please, Cole." Lanna settled her warm winter hat on her elaborate knot of hair. "Can you deliver this all by supper time?"<br><br>"My delivery boy will do his best." He scribbled a note to the boy on the slip, letting him know that Mrs. Wolf was a priority customer. "Hard to say with the storm moving in."<br><br>"Yes, it has the feel of a blizzard out there," Lanna agreed while his daughter bounced up and down in place with her "hurry, Pa" look. "Blessings on your new marriage, and Amelia, I'm so happy you'll have a new mother. What are the odds, I wonder, that she knows what she's getting into?"<br><br>"I'll behave, I promise." Amelia's sweet, heart-shaped face shone with earnestness. Amelia was a good girl, but she was rambunctious, regardless of how much she tried otherwise. Perhaps a prim and proper mother's influence would help curb that.<br><br>It was his only prayer. Mercy Jacobs came across in her letters as quiet and sensible, and heaven knew that was exactly what his daughter needed. Curbing Amelia's unladylike behavior was the true reason he'd agreed to marry a complete stranger. Every woman he'd approached in town either laughed at his convenient marriage proposition or gaped at him with horror.<br><br>At least he hoped Amelia was the reason those women had looked at him that way.<br><br>"I'll take over, boss." Middle-aged and efficient Eberta Quinn bustled over in her sensible brown frock. "I'll finish wrapping Mrs. Wolf's packages."<br><br>As Lanna hurried off to her next shopping errand, other customers piled in. They all had that hungry look, since Christmas was a handful of days away. Cole frowned, debating. "It's getting busy. I don't want to miss an opportunity for a sale. I should stay. Maybe&#x2014;"<br><br>"No," Eberta scolded him, shaking her head. "I know it's a good time for business, but if you don't meet that lady at the train, what will she think? It will make a bad impression."<br><br>"This is a marriage of convenience." He'd been clear about that in his advertisement and in the many letters he'd exchanged with Mrs. Mercy Jacobs. "She's hardly expecting a bouquet and courting words. She'd likely appreciate a friendly greeting. Perhaps you could do it."<br><br>"Pa." Amelia stepped in, rolling her eyes and shaking her head at him as if she wasn't surprised by this at all. "For once, leave the shop to Eberta. This is really important."<br><br>It wasn't the shop he cared about as much as the fact that he wasn't so good at relationships. On this side of the counter, he understood his role. He felt comfortable with it. Greeting customers, totaling up purchases, helping people find what they were looking for. This was a transaction he understood.<br><br>His true worry that he would disappoint Mercy Jacobs, the woman who'd traveled so far with the heartfelt promise to love his daughter. What if she was secretly hoping for some semblance of a real marriage? What if she'd been wishing for a man capable of loving her?<br><br>His heart had been broken so long ago, and he couldn't even remember when it had been whole.<br><br>A whistle sounded in the distance, faint through the walls of the shop.<br><br>"It's coming! We need to hurry." Amelia's much smaller hand crept into his. "Oh, I can't wait to meet my new mother."<br><br>She held on so tight, the way she used to do when she was small.<br><br>It was a reminder that she was still a little girl, that while she'd grown tall and slender, she absolutely needed the woman who would be getting off that train.<br><br>"Angel Falls, next stop!" The conductor's friendly voice boomed through the car.<br><br>A frantic flutter of heartbeats tapped against her sternum. Mercy drew in a slow breath, trying to steady her nerves. This was the moment of truth. When she discovered whether everything Cole Matheson had written about his town, his daughter and himself were true. Her palms went clammy as she worried for her son. How would George feel if Mr. Matheson wasn't the man he claimed to be?<br><br>She smoothed down the boy's flyaway cowlick, willing it to stay down for a good first impression.<br><br><i>Just trust in the Lord,</i> she told herself. <i>Trust the feelings and the signs that have brought you here.</i><br><br>"Look, Ma!" George went up on both knees, struggling to get a good view as the train started its slow descent on the town. "There's horses in that field. <i>Horses."</i><br><br>"So I see." She leaned in, love in her heart for her son, daring to hope for him. "Look at them run."<br><br>"They're racin' the train. Wow." George pressed his nose against the glass, hungry to lap up the sight of the majestic creatures in shades of blacks and browns galloping against the snowy-white world. His boyish shoulders lifted up with satisfaction. "What if those are Mr. Matheson's horses? What if one of 'em will be mine?"<br><br>"That would be nice, wouldn't it?" She let her son dream, her sweet good boy, giving thanks for the man who'd promised to give George one of his horses and riding lessons. Everything George had been dreaming. Her throat closed up tight. She needed to believe Cole was a man who kept his promises. Her late husband, Timothy, had meant well, but he hadn't been so good with that. She hoped history wasn't about to repeat itself.<br><br>A touch on her sleeve caught her attention. The conductor stood there, smiling down at her, his gray hair peeking out from beneath his cap. "I'll get your satchels for you, ma'am. You have your attention full with your fine son."<br><br>"I'm gonna learn to ride like a real cowboy." George beamed, his grin ear to ear, his button face flushed pink with pleasure. Why, she'd never seen his navy blue eyes so bright.<br><br>She didn't know what she'd do if Cole Matheson let him down. Tears burned behind her eyes at the thought and she smiled weakly up at the conductor. "Thank you, Mr. Blake."<br><br>"My pleasure." The kindly man set both her and George's satchels on the floor at her feet. "I see you're wearing your mistletoe."<br><br>"I pinned it on. I need all the help I can get." She tried to laugh to hide her reservations, but she feared she didn't quite succeed.<br><br>Something that looked like understanding flashed in the older man's eyes. The anxious flutter in her chest doubled. So much depended on this first meeting. She thanked the conductor, who moved along to help another passenger with her bags, and looked out the window with George.<br><br><i>It does look like a friendly town,</i> she thought over the squealing sound of the brakes.

Richard Cook, the lead resource analyst at NASA for the Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs), was the first to warn of possible catastrophic failure. His memo, which detailed astronaut concerns and warnings from the shuttle builders at Morton Thiokol, were ignored by top NASA officials and members of the Reagan administration. In the aftermath of the explosion, NASA launched an investigation to &#34;discover&#34; the cause of the disaster. Though within NASA there was absolute certainty about the O-ring joint failure, they began a cover-up by publicly proclaiming that the cause of the explosion was unknown. A Reagan administration Commission perpetrated the same lie. And when Richard Cook realized that the Commission was not interested in revealing the truth, he acted as a true patriot and hero and leaked the original O-ring warning documents to the New York Times. His article set off a cascade of disclosures about the events leading up to the disaster, including revelations by Morton Thiokol engineers that they had tried to stop the launch.</p><p>In 1986, Richard Cook became one of the foremost whistleblowers of all time. He has done policy-level work at the U.S. Civil Service Commission, the FDA, and the Jimmy Carter White House. He has also published articles in <i>The Washington Post</i>, <i>Washington Monthly</i>, <i>Space and Security News</i>, and the <i>Houston Post</i>. In 1991, Cook was a recipient of the Cavallo Foundation Award for Moral Courage in Business and Government.<i>Starred Review.</i> A gripping true-life thriller that describes the struggle to discover and disseminate the truth about the 1986 destruction of the space shuttle Challenger, this book provides new and startling material, presented in a spellbinding narrative with direct relevance to the current state of the US government. Former NASA resource analyst Cook, whose long public service record includes 20 years at the Treasury Department, rocketed from anonymous bureaucrat to public fame during the Challenger investigation, and later was awarded the Cavallo Foundation's Award for Moral Courage in Business and Government, for his efforts to uncover the facts about the faulty O-ring seals that led the shuttle's solid rocket boosters to explode. Easily the most informative and important book on the disaster, Cook's work is meticulously documented, augmenting his own insider knowledge with transcripts, memoranda, reports and interviews to provide the first truly comprehensive book on what happened on January 28, 1986, and why. Tracing the history of the space shuttle's design and development, Cook leads readers step-by-step, decision-by-decision to the tragic event. Rather than an accident, Cook concludes that the disaster was the result of Reagan's autocratic management style and closed-door decision-making process. Further documentation shows how the Rogers Commission, charged with investigating the explosion, was conceived as part of a cover-up effort, which also included collusion by some NASA managers, White House operatives and commission head William Rogers. By focusing solely on equipment malfunctions and internal NASA decision-making, it seems that Rogers evaded the most important question: why was it so important to those in power to launch the shuttle on that day? This account, featuring many players still working in government today, is essential reading on the topics of NASA and US government obfuscation.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

One day the sun does shine, so Papa Woolsey clips their hair and the little lambs play outside. But night brings a cold wind, and snow appears in the morning. Alas, the Woolseys no longer have their winter coats to wear outside. But Granny Woolsey has a surprise for everyone--during the night she knitted warm sweaters for all of them from their "haircuts." Just the right note of old fashioned cozy plumpness is displayed in the warm, muted drawings and the pleasant "togetherness" expressed by each of the Woolseys. Delightful illustrations and finely tuned whimsy in a simple story make this a winner with preschoolers. The little rabbits of the Hopkins family, all amusingly attired in a cross between American pioneer and Laura Ashley outfits, go outside to plant a garden. As soon as their mother and father leave, chaos begins--15 bunnies bopping each other with rakes and shovels, dirt flying, seed packets in the air, and the hose spraying over everyone. Order is restored when Mr. and Mrs. Hopkins return, and each bunny is assigned a task in sequence. What everyone finds out is that "there are not too many Hopkins when they are not all in the same place at the same time." The soft, warm colors of dePaola's ink and watercolor drawings quietly capture the comfortable feeling of the story, and each bunny is so carefully delineated that this book can also be used as a counting book--up to 15 little bunnies and 2 big bunnies. --Louise M.

Yet not much has been written on the subject. This wonderful book remedies that. It is a compilation of articles from three of the outstanding carriage journals of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and covers almost every imaginable type of sleigh: Albany (or swell-body), Portland cutter, speeding cutter, multi-passenger, box-body, trap and sporting sleighs, Canadian, rumble-seat, cabriolet, vis-a-vis, closed-body, and more. Not only are these various sleighs fully illustrated with detailed line drawings, but full descriptions are given covering dimensions, materials used, trim, and painting details. In addition, the last part of the book provides much valuable information on sleigh construction: ironing, body design, painting, and trimming. The topics are enriched with the more than 360 line drawings that are original to the articles. The reader will find this book a treasure-house of information, an invaluable sourcebook. 271 pages. 362 illustrations. 81/2&#34; x 11&#34;.

In this elegant, updated, illustrated edition, the superstitions, academic discoveries and myths surrounding the life of one of the world's greatest poets are evoked through a series of full-color paintings, drawings, portraits, documents and photographs. Bryson also discusses the recent discoveries of the Cobbe portrait and the remains of Shakespeare's first theatre in Shoreditch.</p> <p>The centuries of mysteries, half-truths and downright lies about Shakespeare are deftly explored, as Bryson draws a picture that includes many aspects of the poet's life, making sense of the man behind the masterpieces. In a journey down the streets of Shakespeare's time, Bryson brings to life the hubbub of Elizabethan England and delights in details of his folios and quartos, poetry and plays. He celebrates the glory of Shakespeare's language and his ceaseless inventiveness, which gave us hundreds of now indispensable phrases, images and words.</p></p><p><p> Bill Bryson is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>A Walk in the Woods, The Lost Continent, The Mother Tongue, Neither Here Nor There, Made in America, Notes from a Small Island, Notes from a Big Country, Down Under, The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid, Shakespeare: The World as Stage, At Home</i>, and <i>A Short History of Nearly Everything</i>, which was shortlisted for the Samuel Johnson Prize, won the Aventis Prize for Science Books, and was awarded the Descartes Science Communication Prize. Born in Des Moines, Iowa, Bryson now lives in Norfolk, England, with his wife and four children. </p>Little is known about Shakespeares life, and in this brief biography Bryson makes no attempt to expand on the known details, as other authors have. Starting by presenting the paucity of facts, he goes on to sketch the life of the worlds greatest playwright, from Stratford to London and back again. He also discusses the theories suggesting that Shakespeares works were written by someone else, dismissing them as ludicrous. While Brysons prose sparkles with Bard-worthy wit, his reading is lackluster, and this reviewer wonders why he doesnt entrust his audiobooks to more experienced narrators. This is an interesting, though brief, book about the Bard, and it deserves better.

She lives in Boston. Visit her website: www.alicehoffman.com<i>ONE<br><br></i><br> <br>the world in a globe<br><br>y<i>ou would think </i><i>it would be impossible to find anything new in the world, creatures no man has ever seen before, one-of-a kind oddities in which nature has taken a backseat to the coursing pulse of the fantastical and the marvelous. I can tell you with certainty that such things exist, for beneath the water there are beasts as huge as elephants with hundreds of legs, and in the skies, rocks thrown alit from the heavens burn through the bright air and fall to earth. There are men with such odd characteristics they must hide their faces in order to pass through the streets unmolested, and women who have such peculiar features they live in rooms without mirrors. My father kept me away from such anomalies when I was young, though I lived above the exhibition that he owned in Coney Island, the Museum of Extraordinary Things. Our house was divided into two distinct sections; half we lived in, the other half housed the exhibitions. In this way, my father never had to leave what he loved best in the world. He had added on to the original house, built in 1862, the year the Coney Island and Brooklyn Railroad began the first horse- drawn carriage line to our city. My father created the large hall in which to display the living wonders he employed, all of whom performed unusual acts or were born with curious attributes that made others willing to pay to see them.<br><br></i><br> <br><i><br>&nbsp;<br></i><br> <br><i><br>&nbsp;<br></i><br> <br><i>My father was both a scientist and a magician, but he declared that it was in literature wherein we discovered our truest natures. When I was only a child he gave me the poet Whitman to read, along with the plays of Shakespeare. In such great works I found enlightenment and came to understand that everything God creates is a miracle, individually and unto itself. A rose is the pinnacle of beauty, but no more so than the exhibits in my father&#x2019;s museum, each artfully arranged in a wash of formaldehyde inside a large glass container. The displays my father presented were unique in all the world: the preserved body of a perfectly formed infant without eyes, unborn monkey twins holding hands, a tiny snow-white alligator with enormous jaws. I often sat upon the stairs and strained to catch a glimpse of such marvels through the dark. I believed that each remarkable creature had been touched by God&#x2019;s hand, and that anything singular was an amazement to humankind, a hymn to our maker.<br><br></i><br> <br><i>When I needed to go through the museum to the small wood-paneled room where my father kept his library, so that he might read to me, he would blindfold me so I wouldn&#x2019;t be shocked by the shelves of curiosities that brought throngs of customers through the doors, especially in the summertime, when the beaches and the grander parks were filled with crowds from Manhattan, who came by carriage and ferry, day-trip steamship or streetcar. But the blindfold my father used was made of thin muslin, and I could see through the fabric if I kept my eyes wide. There before me were the many treasures my father had collected over the years: the hand with eight fingers, the human skull with horns, the preserved remains of a scarlet-colored long-legged bird called a spoonbill, rocks veined with luminous markings that glowed yellow in the dark, as if stars themselves had been trapped inside stone. I was fascinated by all that was strange: the jaw of an ancient elephant called a mastodon and the shoes of a giant found in the mountains of Switzerland. Though these exhibits made my skin prickle with fear, I felt at home among such things. Yet I knew that a life spent inside a museum is not a life like any other. Sometimes I had dreams in which the jars broke and the floor was awash with a murky green mixture of water and salt and formaldehyde. When I woke from such nightmares, the hem of my nightgown would be soaking wet. It made me wonder how far the waking world was from the world of dreams<br><br></i><br> <br><i>My mother died of influenza when I was only an infant, and although I never knew her, whenever I dreamed of terrible, monstrous creatures and awoke shivering and crying in my bed, I wished I had a mother who loved me. I always hoped my father would sing me to sleep, and treat me as if I were a treasure, as valued as the museum exhibits he often paid huge sums to buy, but he was too busy and preoccupied, and I understood his life&#x2019;s work was what mattered most. I was a dutiful daughter, at least until I reached a certain age. I was not allowed to play with other children, who would not have understood where I lived or how I&#x2019;d been raised, nor could I go upon the streets of Brooklyn on my own, where there were men who were waiting to molest innocent girls like me.<br><br></i><br> <br><i><br>&nbsp;<br></i><br> <br><i>Long ago what the Indians called Narrioch was a deserted land, used in winter for grazing cattle and horses and oxen. The Dutch referred to it as Konijn Eylandt, Rabbit Island, and had little interest in its sandy shores. Now there were those who said Coney Island had become a vile place, much like Sodom, where people thought only of pleasure. Some communities, like Brighton Beach and Manhattan Beach, where the millionaires built their estates, had their own trains with paid conductors to keep out the riffraff. Trains for the masses left from the Brooklyn Bridge Terminal and took little more than half an hour to reach the beachfront communities. The subway was being built, to begin running beneath the East River in 1908, so that more and more throngs would be able to leave the brutal heat of Manhattan in the summertime. The island was a place of contradiction, stretching from the wicked areas where men were alternately entertained and cheated in houses of ill repute and saloons, to the iron pavilions and piers where the great John Philip Sousa had<br><br></i><br> <br><i>brought his orchestra to play beneath the stars in the year I was born. Coney Island was, above all else, a place of dreams, with amusements like no others, rides that defied the rules of gravity, concerts and games of chance, ballrooms with so many electric lights they glowed as if on fire. It was here that there had once been a hotel in the shape of an elephant which proudly stood 162 feet high until it burned to the ground, here the world&#x2019;s first roller coaster, the Switchback Railway, gave birth to more and more elaborate and wilder rides.<br><br></i><br> <br><i>The great parks were the Steeplechase and Luna Park, whose star attraction, the famous horse King, dove from a high platform into a pool of water. On Surf Avenue was the aptly named Dreamland, which was being built and would soon rise across the street, so that we could see its towers from our garden path. There were hundreds of other attractions along Surf Avenue, up to Ocean Parkway, so many entertainments I didn&#x2019;t know how people chose. For me the most beautiful constructions were the carousels, with their magical bejeweled carved animals, many created by Jewish craftsmen from the Ukraine. The El Dorado, which was being installed at the foot of Dreamland Park, was a true amazement, three-tiered and teeming with animals of every sort. My favorites were the tigers, so fierce their green eyes sparked with an inner light, and, of course, the horses with their manes flying out behind them, so real I imagined that if I were ever allowed onto one, I might ride away and never return.<br><br></i><br> <br><i>Electricity was everywhere, snaking through Brooklyn, turning night into day. Its power was evident in a showing made by electrocuting a poor elephant named Topsy, who had turned on a cruel, abusive trainer. I was not yet ten when Edison planned to prove that his form of electricity was safe, while declaring that his rival, Westinghouse, had produced something that was a danger to the world. If Westinghouse&#x2019;s method could kill a pachyderm, what might it do to the common man? I happened to be there on that day, walking home from the market with our housekeeper, Maureen. There was a huge, feverish crowd gathered, all waiting to see the execution, though it was January and the chill was everywhere.<br><br></i><br> <br><i>&#x201c;Keep walking,&#x201d; Maureen said, not breaking her stride, pulling me along by my arm. She had on a wool coat and a green felt hat, her most prized possession, bought from a famed milliner on Twenty-third Street in Manhattan. She was clearly disgusted by the bloodthirsty atmosphere. &#x201c;People will disappoint you with their cruelty every time.&#x201d;<br><br></i><br> <br><i>I wasn&#x2019;t so sure Maureen was right, for there was compassion to be found among the crowd as well. I had spied a girl on a bench with her mother. She was staring at poor Topsy and crying. She appeared to be keeping a vigil, a soulful little angel with a fierce expression. I, myself, did not dare to show my fury or indulge in my true emotions. I wished I might have sat beside this other girl, and held her hand, and had her as my friend, but I was forced away from the dreadful scene. In truth, I never had a friend of my own age, though I longed for one.<br><br></i><br> <br><i>All the same, I loved Brooklyn and the magic it contained. The city was my school, for although compulsory education laws had gone into effect in 1894, no one enforced them, and it was easy enough to escape public education. My father, for instance, sent a note to the local school board stating I was disabled, and this was accepted without requirement of any further proof. Coney Island then was my classroom, and it was a wondrous one. The parks were made of papier-m�ch�, steel, and electricity, and their glow could be seen for miles, as though our city was a fairyland. Another girl in my constrained circumstances might have made a ladder out of strips torn from a quilt, or formed a rope fashioned of her own braided hair so she might let herself out the window and experience the enchantment of the shore. But whenever I had such disobedient thoughts, I would close my eyes and tell myself I was ungrateful. I was convinced that my mother, were she still alive, would be disappointed in me if I failed to do as I was told.<br><br></i><br> <br><i><br>&nbsp;<br></i><br> <br><i>My father&#x2019;s museum employed a dozen or more living players during the season. Each summer the acts of wonder performed in the exhibition hall several times a day, in the afternoon and in the evenings, each displaying his or her own rare qualities. I was not allowed to speak to them, though I longed to hear the stories of their lives and learn how they came to be in Brooklyn. I was too young, my father said. Children under the age of ten were not allowed inside the museum, owing to their impressionable natures. My father included me in this delicate group. If one of the wonders was to pass I was to lower my eyes, count to fifty, and pretend that person didn&#x2019;t exist. They came and went over the years, some returning for more seasons, others vanishing without a word. I never got to know the Siamese twins who were mirror images of each other, their complexions veined with pallor, or the man with a pointed head, who drowsed between his performances, or the woman who grew her hair so long she could step on it. They all left before I could speak my first words. My memories were of glances, for such people were never gruesome to me, they were unique and fascinating, and terribly brave in the ways they revealed their most secret selves.<br><br></i><br> <br><i>Despite my father&#x2019;s rules, as I grew older I would peer down from my window in the early mornings, when the employees arrived in the summer light, many wearing cloaks despite the mild weather, to ensure they would not be gawked at, perhaps even beaten, on their way to their employment. My father called them wonders, but to the world they were freaks. They hid their features so that there would be no stones flung, no sheriff&#x2019;s men called in, no children crying out in terror and surprise. In the streets of New York they were considered abominations, and because there were no laws to protect them, they were often ill used. I hoped that on our porch, beneath the shade of the pear tree, they would find some peace.<br><br></i><br> <br><i><br>&nbsp;<br></i><br> <br><i>My father had come to this country from France. He called himself Professor Sardie, though that was not in fact his name. When I asked what his given name had been, he said it was nobody&#x2019;s business. We all have secrets, he&#x2019;d told me often enough, nodding at my gloved hands. I believed my father to be a wise and brilliant man, as I believed Brooklyn to be a place not unlike heaven, where miracles were wrought. The Professor had principles that others might easily call strange, his own personal philosophy of health and well-being. He had been pulled away from magic by science, which he considered far more wondrous than card tricks and sleight of hand. This was why he had become a collector of the rare and unusual, and why he so strictly oversaw the personal details of our lives. Fish was a part of our daily nourishment, for my father believed that we took on the attributes of our diet, and he made certain I ate a meal of fish every day so my constitution might echo the abilities of these creatures. We bathed in ice water, good for the skin and inner organs. My father had a breathing tube constructed so that I could remain soaking underwater in the claw-foot tub, and soon my baths lasted an hour or more. I had only to take a puff of air in order to remain beneath the surface. I felt comfortable in this element, a sort of girlfish, and soon I didn&#x2019;t feel the cold as others did, becoming more and more accustomed to temperatures that would chill others to the bone.<br><br></i><br> <br><i>In the summer my father and I swam in the sea together each night, braving the waves until November, when the tides became too frigid. Several times we nearly reached Dead Horse Bay, more than five miles away, a far journey for even the most experienced swimmer. We continued an exercise routine all through the winter so that we might increase our breathing capacity, sprinting along the shore. &#x201c;Superior health calls for superior action,&#x201d; my father assured me. He believed running would maintain our health and vigor when it was too cold to swim. We trotted along the shore in the evenings, our skins shimmering with sweat, ignoring people in hats and overcoats who laughed at us and shouted out the same half-baked joke over and over again: &#x201c;What are you running from?&#x201d; &#x201c;You&#x201d;, my father would mutter. &#x201c;Fools not worth listening to&#x201d;, he told me.<br><br></i><br> <br><i>Sometimes it would snow, but we would run despite the weather, for our regimen was strict. All the same, on snowy nights I would lag behind so I might appreciate the beauty of the beach. I would reach into the snow-dotted water. The frozen shore made me think of diamonds. I was enchanted by these evenings. The ebb and flow at the shore was bone white, asparkle. My breath came out in a fog and rose into the milky sky. Snow fell on my eyelashes, and all of Brooklyn turned white, a world in a globe. Every snowflake that I caught was a miracle unlike any other.<br><br></i><br> <br><i><br>&nbsp;<br></i><br> <br><i><br>&nbsp;<br></i><br> <br><i>I had long black hair that I wore braided, and I possessed a serious and quiet demeanor.

Raised by her transcendentalist parents, Abigail May and Amos Bronson Alcott in New England, she grew up among many of the well-known intellectuals of the day such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau. Nevertheless, her family suffered severe financial difficulties and Alcott worked to help support the family from an early age. She began to receive critical success for her writing in the 1860s. Early in her career, she sometimes used the pen name A. M. Barnard and under it wrote novels for young adults. Published in 1868, Little Women is set in the Alcott family home, Orchard House, in Concord, Massachusetts and is loosely based on Alcott's childhood experiences with her three sisters. The novel was very well received and is still a popular children's novel today, filmed several times. Alcott was an abolitionist and a feminist and remained unmarried throughout her life. She died in Boston on March 6, 1888. Henry James called her "The novelist of children... the Thackeray, the Trollope, of the nursery and the schoolroom.&#x201d;</p><h2>Notary Signing Agent Certification Course: The Most Complete and Helpful Self-Education Program for Notary Signing Agents</h2><p>The &#34;Notary Signing Agent Certification Course&#34; is essential in preparing for Parts I and II of the National Notary Association&#39;s three-part Notary Signing Agent Certification Examination.

From the very beginning of its statehood in 1948, protecting the nation from harm has been the responsibility of its intelligence community and armed services, and there is one weapon in their vast arsenal that they have relied upon to thwart the most serious threats: Targeted assassinations have been used countless times, on enemies large and small, sometimes in response to attacks against the Israeli people and sometimes preemptively. In this page-turning, eye-opening book, journalist and military analyst Ronen Bergman - praised by David Remnick as &#34;arguably [Israel&#39;s] best investigative reporter&#34; - offers a riveting inside account of the targeted killing programs: their successes, their failures, and the moral and political price exacted on the men and women who approved and carried out the missions. Built from interviews with Israeli Prime Ministers as well as high-level figures in Mossad, and the country&#39;s military and intelligence services - Rise and Kill First includes never-before-reported, behind-the-curtain accounts of key operations, and based on hundreds of on-the-record interviews and thousands of previously unseen files. Bergman traces, from statehood to the present, the gripping events and thorny ethical questions underlying Israel&#39;s targeted killing campaign, which has shaped the Israeli nation, the Middle East, and the entire world.</p><p></p><h2>Honor: A History</h2><p>The importance of honor is present in the earliest records of civilization.

Dough.</i> Whatever you call it, money makes the world go round. The United States is dispensing its first redesigned bills in decades, and the Euro is on the brink of unifying European notes. It's the perfect time for this visual tour of the world's currencies. The various people, places, animals, and historical events depicted on money reflect how countries see themselves&#x2014;and how they want the rest of world to see them. Author David Standish begins with a brief, fascinating history of currency, and then presents a striking gallery of international bills from more than 80 countries that corner the market on visual flair. The cast of characters on these small canvases is vast&#x2014;from the Little Prince on French currency to the furry denizens of the rainforest of Madagascar to the obscure Salmon P. Chase, Abraham Lincoln's Secretary of State, on the $10,000 US note (did you know that the US Secret Service originated with Lincoln's efforts to curb counterfeiting during the Civil War?). <i>The Art of Money</i> is an entertaining and lustrous tour of cash for design aficionados, history buffs, travelers, and everybody who handles money (or dreams of handling more).</p><p>David Standish is a freelance writer and former articles editor of Playboy. He has contributed to numerous publications, including Smithsonian, Esquire, Rolling Stone, Travel &amp; Leisure, and Outside. He lives in Chicago.Beginning with the sunflowers on the Netherlands' 50-gulden note (Standish loves them) and ending with the redesigned American fives, tens and twenties (hates them), Standish's handsome, offbeat and color reproduction-stuffed volume displays and describes the world's various paper moneys. Standish, a journalist and former Playboy articles editor, sometimes looks at currency design as a matter of pure aestheticsDwhat colors, where? What kinds of lines, and why? But he also shows how "countries project their self-image through their money," recording their history and deciding what they want their visitors to see. He includes the "tough guys"Dmythic rebels and pre-Columbian godsDon much Latin American dinero; the engraved airplanes on Singapore's money, which promote its national airline; and the countenance of Queen Elizabeth, which graces more nationalities' cash than any other phiz. A "Short History of Money" explains, and depicts, the evolution of coinage and then of bills in Greece, Rome and medieval China, whose reliance on bills gave it, in the 10th century, "the world's first hyperinflation." A final chapter surveys American money, which at various points depicted Washington crossing the Delaware, Ben Franklin with a kite, and "Pocahontas getting baptized."

This innovative book examines the most successful interracial coalition in the nineteenth-century South, Virginia's Readjuster Party, and uncovers a surprising degree of fluidity in postemancipation southern politics. <br><br>Melding social, cultural, and political history, Jane Dailey chronicles the Readjusters' efforts to foster political cooperation across the color line. She demonstrates that the power of racial rhetoric, and the divisiveness of racial politics, derived from the everyday experiences of individual Virginians--from their local encounters on the sidewalk, before the magistrate's bench, in the schoolroom. In the process, she reveals the power of black and white southerners to both create and resist new systems of racial discrimination. The story of the Readjusters shows how hard white southerners had to work to establish racial domination after emancipation, and how passionately black southerners fought each and every infringement of their rights as Americans.<br><br></p><p>"A nicely written and sharply observed study, which adds theoretical precision and empirical substance to the growing body of scholarship that treats race as a socially constructed, rather than a 'natural,' category of historical analysis."-- <i>Journal of American Studies</i> <br>This innovative book examines the most successful interracial coalition in the nineteenth-century South, Virginia&#39;s Readjuster Party, and uncovers a surprising degree of fluidity in postemancipation southern politics.</p><h2>POINT OF IMPACT.</h2><p><b>The inspiration for the USA Network series <i>Shooter</i>&nbsp;-- "...

His mysterious nature was not only due to his upbringing in Romania&#x2014;which, at the time, was still regarded by much of Europe as a backward country haunted by vampires and werewolves&#x2014;but also because Brancusi was aware that myth and an aura of otherness appealed to the public. His self-mythology remained intact until the publication of <i>Brancusi </i>in 1986 by Romanian artists Alexandre Istrati and Natalia Dumitresco, who made available a small selection of the archive of Brancusi&#x2019;s correspondence. And in 2003, a comprehensive catalogue, which made the bulk of Brancusi&#x2019;s private correspondence public for the first time, was published by the Centre Pompidou to accompany a retrospective on Brancusi&#x2019;s work.</p><p>In <i>Constantin Brancusi</i>, Sanda Miller employs these extensive new resources to better assess Brancusi&#x2019;s life and work in relationship to each other, providing valuable and innovative insights into his relationships with friends, collectors, dealers and lovers. Miller&#x2019;s perceptive book allows Brancusi to finally take his rightful place among the most important of the intellectual personalities who shaped twentieth-century modernism.</p></p><p>Sanda Miller is the first Western European historian to have subjected Brancusi to exhaustive analysis: being Romanian by birth, she has a full knowledge of the literature and is able to bring to bear Romanian memoirs, literary texts, histories, and recent scholarship with confidence and to make a new range of knowledge accessible to western readers. The material on Brancusi&#39;s childhood and training both as a craftsman and fine artist at the School of Arts and Crafts in Craiova and the Academy of Fine Arts in Bucharest respectively, provides a new basis for the assessment of his work, after as well as before his arrival in Paris. Brancusi is accepted as a major figure in histories of twentieth-century sculpture. Where the problems of sculpture, craft and materials, of formalism and the avant-garde or of &#39;primitivism&#39; in modernism are concerned, he will remain a major figure to be discussed. This is a substantial contribution to knowledge about Brancusi and his work which includes many illustrations never previously published.<p><b>Sanda Miller</b> is a senior lecturer in fashion writing and culture at Southampton Solent University.&nbsp; Her previous books include <i>Constantin Brancusi: A Survey of His Work</i> and <i>The Dark Night of the Soul: Ana Maria Pacheco</i>.</p></p><h2>Violent Entrepreneurs: The Use of Force in the Making of Russian Capitalism</h2><p><p>Entering the shady world of what he calls "violent entrepreneurship," Vadim Volkov explores the economic uses of violence and coercion in Russia in the 1990s. Violence has played, he shows, a crucial role in creating the institutions of a new market economy. The core of his work is competition among so-called violence-managing agencies&#x2015;criminal groups, private security services, private protection companies, and informal protective agencies associated with the state&#x2015;which multiplied with the liberal reforms of the early 1990s. This competition provides an unusual window on the dynamics of state formation.</p><p>Violent Entrepreneurs is remarkable for its research. Volkov conducted numerous interviews with members of criminal groups, heads of protection companies, law enforcement employees, and businesspeople. He bases his findings on journalistic and anecdotal evidence as well as on his own personal observation.</p><p>Volkov investigates the making of violence-prone groups in sports clubs (particularly martial arts clubs), associations for veterans of the Soviet&#x2015;Afghan war, ethnic gangs, and regionally based social groups, and he traces the changes in their activities across the decade. Some groups wore state uniforms and others did not, but all of their members spoke and acted essentially the same and were engaged in the same activities: intimidation, protection, information gathering, dispute management, contract enforcement, and taxation. Each group controlled the same resource&#x2015;organized violence.</p></p><p><p>Vadim Volkov is Associate Professor of Sociology at The European University at St. Petersburg. His articles have appeared in Social Research, Politics and Society, and Europe-Asia Studies.</p><p>"This is a splendid book, a well-written and well-researched contribution to the field that deserves a wide and appreciative readership.... This excellent, literate, and insightful work is both scholarly enough to advance study of Russian criminality and 'violent capitalism' into fruitful new avenues and readable enough that it need not scare off undergraduates&#x2015;and as such to be welcomed wholeheartedly."</p> (<i>Slavic Review</i>)<br><br><p>"Volkov supplies the missing link between almost everything else you may read about business in post-Communist Russia and almost everything else you can read about organized crime there. He treats the two activities, business and crime, with equal respect as fields of sociological inquiry, and so arrives at the first satisfying account of how they affect each other."</p> (<i>New York Review of Books</i>)<br><br><p>"A richly documented, complex book....

The memoir of Academician Boris Chertok, translated from the original Russian, fills that gap. In Volume 1 of <i>Rockets and People</i>, Chertok described his early life as an aeronautical engineer and his adventures as a member of the Soviet team that searched postwar, occupied Germany for the remnants of the Nazi rocket program. &nbsp; In Volume 2, Chertok takes up the story after his return to the Soviet Union in 1946, when Stalin ordered the foundation of the postwar missile program at an old artillery factory northeast of Moscow. Chertok gives an unprecedented view into the early days of the Soviet missile program. With a keen talent for combining technical and human interests, Chertok writes of the origins and creation of the Baykonur Cosmodrome in a remote desert region of Kazakhstan. &nbsp; He devotes a substantial portion of Volume 2 to describing the launch of the first Sputnik satellite and the early lunar and interplanetary probes designed under legendary Chief Designer Sergey Korolev in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He ends with a detailed description of the famous R-16 catastrophe known as the &#x201c;Nedelin disaster,&#x201d; which killed scores of engineers during preparations for a missile launch in 1960.</p><p><p>&nbsp;</p> Chertok began his career as an electrician in 1930 at an aviation factory near Moscow. Thirty years later, he was deputy to the founding figure of the Soviet space program, the mysterious &#x201c;Chief Designer&#x201d; Sergey Korolev.&nbsp;Chertok&#x2019;s sixty-year-long career and the many successes and failures of the Soviet space program constitute the core of his memoirs, <i>Rockets and People.</i> &nbsp; This book was edited by Dr. Asif Siddiqi, a historian of Russian space exploration, and Gen. Tom Stafford contributed a foreword touching upon his significant work with the Russians on the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project.&nbsp;Overall, this book is an engaging read while also contributing much new material to the literature about the Soviet space program. &nbsp; <p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Flag: An American Biography</h2><p>The nation turns to it as an emotional, political, and patriotic symbol in good times and bad. Americans fly it everywhere we live and everywhere we go, from front porches in Florida to pickup trucks in Alaska. We display the red-white-and-blue American flag at festive events to celebrate and, at times of national tragedy, to grieve and show our resolve. We wrap ourselves in it in displays of patriotism, politics, nationalism, and jingoism.<br>The thirteen-stripe, fifty-star flag is as familiar an American icon as any that has existed in the nation&#x2019;s history. It stirs something in the hearts of Americans like no other symbol. Yet the history of the flag, especially its origins, is cloaked in myth and misinformation. <i>Flag: An American Biography</i> rectifies that situation by presenting a lively, comprehensive, illuminating look at the history of the American flag from its beginnings to today.<br>Journalist, historian, and author of the highly acclaimed <i>Saving Monticello</i><i>,</i> Leepson uncovers scores of little-known, fascinating facts as he traces the evolution of the American flag from the Colonial period to its prominent role as a symbol of American resolve in today&#x2019;s war against terrorism. <br><i>Flag</i> sifts through the historical evidence to---among many other things---uncover the truth behind the Betsy Ross myth and to discover the true designer of the stars and stripes. The book also shines informing light on a string of colorful and influential Americans who shaped the history of the American flag. <br>Leepson analyzes the influence and impact of the maker of the star-spangled banner, Mary Pickersgill; the author of the national anthem, Francis Scott Key; the coiner of the phrase &#x201c;Old Glory,&#x201d; U.S. Navy Capt. Samuel Driver; the first officer killed in the Civil War, Union Col. Elmer Ellsworth, who died defending the flag; the first African-American Medal of Honor recipient, William Carney, who carried the flag and led troops through a viciously bloody Civil War battle; the creator of Flag Day, Wisconsin schoolteacher B. J. Cigrand; the father of the pledge of allegiance, Francis Bellamy; and Joe Rosenthal, the AP photographer who took the most reproduced image of the twentieth century, the marines raising the American flag at Iwo Jima.<br> The American flag was seen as a symbol of a &#x201c;divine plan&#x201d; for the American ideal during the Civil War; as a symbol of the nation&#x2019;s historical heritage at the 1876 centennial celebrations; as a symbol conveying respect for the government and our social institutions---the so-called &#x201c;cult of the flag&#x201d;---in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. During the Vietnam War, the flag was a divisive emblem in a bitterly divided nation. In the wake of the events of September 11, 2001, the flag became an instant and widely used symbol of a nation united against terrorism.<br>&#x201c;<i>Flag</i><i>,</i>&#x201d; as the novelist Nelson DeMille says in his preface, &#x201c;is not a book with an agenda or a subjective point of view.

But that is not all they found. In Mallory's pockets, and elsewhere on the mountain, the researchers found answers to the question that has plagued historians and mountaineers alike: Did they make it? And if they did, what happened to them?<br>Ghosts of Everest is the exclusive inside story of what they found and, for the first time, what this new evidence tells us about Mallory and Irvine's momentous last day.</p><p>For three quarters of a century, adventure enthusiasts around the globe have speculated about the fate of British mountaineers George Mallory and Andrew Irvine. Did they reach the peak of Mount Everest before disappearing on June 6, 1924? How did they die? What was their fatal mistake? In 1999, the Mallory &amp; Irvine Research Expedition set out to answer these questions by retracing the steps of the doomed climbers, and in <i>The Ghosts of Everest</i>, they share their findings. William Nothdurft has gracefully woven the testimonies of expedition members Jochen Hemmleb, Eric Simonson, and Larry Johnson, all the while counterpointing the modern ascent with a captivating reconstruction of what befell the earlier one. There are also stunning photographs, which manage to be inspiring and beautiful and gruesome--occasionally all at once. And while it's impossible to establish <i>exactly</i> what happened to Mallory and Irvine, this account is persuasive enough to fascinate rock climbers and couch potatoes alike. <i>--Melissa Asher</i>When a 1999 research expedition found the remains of Everest explorer Leigh Mallory, hopes soared that the discovery might settle, once and for all, the question as to whether the British explorer reached the summit of the world's highest peak in 1924. This account offers both the history of the 1999 trek and that of the 1924 attempt. Arthur Addison brings a hushed respect to his telling of the story, perhaps too hushed. In passages of dialogue his voice drops to a near whisper, no matter what the subject of the conversation. And his awe of any serious Everest climber somewhat overshadows the excitement of the tale. Still, pacing, diction and pronunciation are accurate, and the story is gripping enough to survive any performance.

I first read Jon Hassler's Staggerford when I was a sophomore or a junior in high school. I'm not totally sure which. Talking about this book with a friend was one of the first conversations I ever had when I thought, "Wow, she gets it too!" I've read just about all of his novels since. No one captures the small town subtleties - the quirks and the quiet dignity - with as much warmth as Jon Hassler. My friend eventually moved to Minneapolis and has seen the author about a dozen times. I don't think she moved to Minnesota just to stalk Mr. Hassler, but it is a nice plus for her. Working in the office, I've read his books before they've been published and seen the comments from his editor and his letters as the manuscript become a final novel. I've never actually spoken to him though which, in a way, I like. You see, I love all of his books but when I think of Jon Hassler, I picture the warm, quiet, intelligent gentleman and slightly awkward and anxious observer- that is Miles Pruitt, the hero of Staggerford.

If the first reports are to be believed, Joseph Ricardo died as he had lived. The distinction, if one can call it that, of being the last human whose birth was officially recorded, unrelated as it was to any personal virtue or talent, had always been difficult for him to handle. And now he is dead. The news was given to us here in Britain on the nine o&#x2019;clock programme of the State Radio Service and I heard it fortuitously. I had settled down to begin this diary of the last half of my life when I noticed the time and thought I might as well catch the headlines to the nine o&#x2019;clock bulletin. Ricardo&#x2019;s death was the last item mentioned, and then only briefly, a couple of sentences delivered without emphasis in the newscaster&#x2019;s carefully non-committal voice. But it seemed to me, hearing it, that it was a small additional justification for beginning the diary today; the first day of a new year and my fiftieth birthday. As a child I had always liked that distinction, despite the inconvenience of having it follow Christmas too quickly so that one present &#x2013; it never seemed notably superior to the one I would in any case have received &#x2013; had to do for both celebrations.<br><br>As I begin writing, the three events, the New Year, my fiftieth birthday, Ricardo&#x2019;s death, hardly justify sullying the first pages of this new loose-leaf notebook. But I shall continue, one small additional defence against personal accidie. If there is nothing to record, I shall record the nothingness and then if, and when, I reach old age &#x2013; as most of us can expect to, we have become experts at prolonging life &#x2013; I shall open one of my tins of hoarded matches and light my small personal bonfire of vanities. I have no intention of leaving the diary as a record of one man&#x2019;s last years. Even in my most egotistical moods I am not as self-deceiving as that. What possible interest can there be in the journal of Theodore Faron, Doctor of Philosophy, Fellow of Merton College in the University of Oxford, historian of the Victorian age, divorced, childless, solitary, whose only claim to notice is that he is cousin to Xan Lyppiatt, the dictator and Warden of England. No additional personal record is, in any case, necessary. All over the world nation states are preparing to store their testimony for the posterity which we can still occasionally convince ourselves may follow us, those creatures from another planet who may land on this green wilderness and ask what kind of sentient life once inhabited it. We are storing our books and manuscripts, the great paintings, the musical scores and instruments, the artefacts. The world&#x2019;s greatest libraries will in forty years&#x2019; time at most be darkened and sealed. The buildings, those that are still standing, will speak for themselves. The soft stone of Oxford is unlikely to survive more than a couple of centuries. Already the University is arguing about whether it is worth refacing the crumbling Sheldonian. But I like to think of those mythical creatures landing in St. Peter&#x2019;s Square and entering the great Basilica, silent and echoing under the centuries of dust. Will they realize that this was once the greatest of man&#x2019;s temples to one of his many gods? Will they be curious about his nature, this deity who was worshipped with such pomp and splendour, intrigued by the mystery of his symbol, at once so simple, the two crossed sticks, ubiquitous in nature, yet laden with gold, gloriously jewelled and adorned? Or will their values and their thought processes be so alien to ours that nothing of awe or wonder will be able to touch them? But despite the discovery &#x2013; in 1997 was it? &#x2013; of a planet which the astronomers told us could support life, few of us really believe that they will come. They must be there. It is surely unreasonable to credit that only one small star in the immensity of the universe is capable of developing and supporting intelligent life. But we shall not get to them and they will not come to us.<br><br>Twenty years ago, when the world was already half convinced that our species had lost for ever the power to reproduce, the search to find the last-known human birth became a universal obsession, elevated to a matter of national pride, an international contest as ultimately pointless as it was fierce and acrimonious. To qualify the birth had to be officially notified, the date and precise time recorded. This effectively excluded a high proportion of the human race where the day but not the hour was known, and it was accepted, but not emphasized, that the result could never be conclusive. Almost certainly in some remote jungle, in some primitive hut, the last human being had slipped largely unnoticed into an unregarding world. But after months of checking and re-checking, Joseph Ricardo, of mixed race, born illegitimately in a Buenos Aires hospital at two minutes past three Western time on 19 October 1995, had been officially recognized. Once the result was proclaimed, he was left to exploit his celebrity as best he could while the world, as if suddenly aware of the futility of the exercise, turned its attention elsewhere. And now he is dead and I doubt whether any country will be eager to drag the other candidates from oblivion.<br><br>We are outraged and demoralized less by the impending end of our species, less even by our inability to prevent it, than by our failure to discover the cause. Western science and Western medicine haven&#x2019;t prepared us for the magnitude and humiliation of this ultimate failure. There have been many diseases which have been difficult to diagnose or cure and one which almost depopulated two continents before it spent itself. But we have always in the end been able to explain why. We have given names to the viruses and germs which, even today, take possession of us, much to our chagrin since it seems a personal affront that they should still assail us, like old enemies who keep up the skirmish and bring down the occasional victim when their victory is assured. Western science has been our god. In the variety of its power it has preserved, comforted, healed, warmed, fed and entertained us and we have felt free to criticize and occasionally reject it as men have always rejected their gods, but in the knowledge that despite our apostasy, this deity, our creature and our slave, would still provide for us; the anaesthetic for the pain, the spare heart, the new lung, the antibiotic, the moving wheels and the moving pictures. The light will always come on when we press the switch and if it doesn&#x2019;t we can find out why. Science was never a subject I was at home with. I understood little of it at school and I understand little more now that I&#x2019;m fifty. Yet it has been my god too, even if its achievements are incomprehensible to me, and I share the universal disillusionment of those whose god has died. I can clearly remember the confident words of one biologist spoken when it had finally become apparent that nowhere in the whole world was there a pregnant woman: &#x201c;It may take us some time to discover the cause of this apparent universal infertility.&#x201d; We have had twenty-five years and we no longer even expect to succeed. Like a lecherous stud suddenly stricken with impotence, we are humiliated at the very heart of our faith in ourselves. For all our knowledge, our intelligence, our power, we can no longer do what the animals do without thought. No wonder we both worship and resent them.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>Emotional Blackmail: when the people in your life use fear, obligation and guilt to manipulate you</h2><p>The author of <i>Toxic Parents </i>offers a provocative look at the devastating effects of emotional blackmail and manipulation on a relationship and presents a wide range of strategies to help strengthen relationships and break the blackmail cycle. 100,000 first printing. $60,000 ad/promo.

Hen Randolph is the perfect choice for sheriff, but he&#39;s no one&#39;s idea of a model husband. Then a beauty with a tarnished reputation catches his eye, and the thought of taking a wife suddenly appeals to him as never before.</p><p>The new sheriff of Sycamore Flats has a reputation as a gunslinger and a killer. Laurel Blackthorne doesn't want to have anything to do with him even though she should be grateful to him for saving her and her son Adam from the rest of the Blackthorne clan. Her husband is dead, but his family believes Adam should be raised with them and Laurel isn't going to let her son go. Laurel has never relied on any man and she doesn't intend to rely on Hen Randolph, or let Adam have anything to do with him. As far as she's concerned, Hen is no better than her husband was - or his family is. Hen is a loner who believes he's just as bad as his reputation. He's kind and gentle with Laurel, but he thinks he's empty inside-- unable to love and certainly not worthy of anyone else's love. He admires Laurel, how she stands up to the people in Sycamore Flats who label her and Adam, the way she takes care of herself. Hen also likes Adam and tries to convince Laurel that Adam needs a man in his life to look up to. But he doesn't think he has anything to offer Laurel and Adam, although they have become so important to him. Laurel realizes that her first impression of Hen was wrong. He is a good man who does what he has to do to keep himself, and the people he cares about, from getting hurt. She knows she loves him, but she can't let herself hope for a future with him. As a sheriff, Hen is always in danger and Laurel can't stand the idea of losing him. When the Blackthornes threaten revenge on Hen, Hen's brothers arrive to help him defend the town. Because of Laurel's love, Hen finally understands how important family is and how much his brothers care about him. Hen begins to think he may be worthy of Laurel's love and be able to offer her a better life and be a father to Adam. But the Blackthornes aren't going to let him go without a fight and Hen has a responsibility to the town. When it's all over, he intends to find a way to be with Laurel -no matter what it takes.

In fact, it looked like he might never see military action. After fast-talking his way into the aviation cadet program (he was too short to pass the physical) and earning his wings, he became a heavy-bomber instructor for the Army Air Corps. But it wasn&#x2019;t until Germany&#x2019;s defeat that the ace pilot finally saw combat. Assigned as a B-29 Super-fortress command pilot, he reached Tinian just before the <i>Enola Gay</i> took off to end World War II in the skies over Hiroshima.<br><br>Despite being a senior airline pilot, when the war in Vietnam started, Novosel applied again for active duty. The only thing that the air force was willing to give reserve lieutenant colonels like Novosel to fly, however, was a desk. Resigning his commission, he approached the army, which decided that flying dustoffs (medevac helicopters) in Vietnam was a perfect job for this seasoned aviator. With two tours, 2,038 hours of combat flight, 2,345 aerial missions that evacuated 5,589 wounded, and a Congressional Medal of Honor, it&#x2019;s easy to see that Mike Novosel is a genuine, 24-karat American war hero.</p><p><b>&#x201c;A REMARKABLE READ . . .

Novosel<br><br></b>&#x201c;Chief Warrant Officer (CWO) Novosel, 82d Medical Detachment 45th Medical Company, 68th Medical Group, distinguished himself on 2 October 1969 at Kien Tuong Province, Republic of Vietnam, while serving as commander of a medical evacuation helicopter. He unhesitatingly maneuvered his helicopter into a heavily fortified and defended enemy training area where a group of wounded Vietnamese soldiers were pinned down by a large enemy force. Flying without gunship or other cover and exposed to intense machinegun fire, CWO Novosel was able to locate and rescue a wounded soldier. Since all communications with the beleaguered troops had been lost, he repeatedly circled the battle area, flying at low level under continuous heavy fire, to attract the attention of the scattered friendly troops. This display of courage visibly raised their morale, as they recognized this as a signal to assemble for evacuation. . . . In all, fifteen extremely hazardous extractions were performed in order to remove wounded personnel. As a direct result of his selfless conduct, the lives of twenty-nine soldiers were saved. The extraordinary heroism displayed by CWO Novosel was an inspiration to his comrades in arms and reflects great credit on him, his unit, and the United States Army.&#x201d;</p><h2>C++ Concurrency in Action</h2><p><p><b>Summary</b></p> <p>This bestseller has been updated and revised to cover all the latest changes to C++ 14 and 17! <i>C++ Concurrency in Action, Second Edition</i> teaches you everything you need to write robust and elegant multithreaded applications in C++17.</p> <p>Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications.</p> <p><b>About the Technology</b></p> <p>You choose C++ when your applications need to run fast.

Her early interests included natural history and archaeology, and Potter delighted in sketching fossils and fungi. After briefly illustrating Christmas cards with her brother, Bertram, Potter wrote and illustrated her well-known book,&nbsp;<i>The Tale of Peter Rabbit.</i>&nbsp;The book was rejected by several publishes until Frederick Warne eventually took a risk and published the story in 1902 - a risk that paid off.&nbsp;<i>Peter Rabbit&nbsp;</i>was a huge success and readers loved hearing about Peter's mischevious adventures in the lush English countryside. As she got older, Beatrix Potter became a proud conservationist, working hard to defend the landscape she loved so well against industrialization and logging. Now over one hundred years old,&nbsp;<i>Peter Rabbit</i>&nbsp;and his animal friends have become cultural touchstones and continue to delight readers of all ages.</p><p>Sarah Fabiny is the Editor-in-Chief of series and licensed books at Grosset &amp; Dunlap and the author of&nbsp;<i>Who Was Frida Kahlo? </i>and&nbsp;<i>Who Was Gloria Steinem?</i><p></p><p>Who Was Beatrix Potter?</p><p></p></p><h2>Bok!

Nigella lives in London with her family.Americans trolling for something novel in Italian cookery need look no further than Lawson&#x2019;s latest book, which displays with vivid photographs her unique take on fast, simple dishes. Uncompromising purists may carp that these recipes are not authentic regional Italian; Lawson aims to modernize classic Italian cookery principles to better suit contemporary kitchens. Pastas range from a beautifully baroque yet quickly prepared lasagna to a simple toss of pasta, gorgonzola cheese, fresh spinach leaves, and pistachios. Italian Americans conversant with giambotta will recognize a cousin in Lawson&#x2019;s Italian Tray Bake, loaded with chicken, sausage, and potatoes. Lovely inspirations for vegetable side dishes include roasted brussels sprouts gently herbed and mock mashed potatoes made from semolina. To ensure family contentment, the author has made use of the palates of her own teenage children. A few recipes, such as a turkey breast stuffed with sausage and cranberries, make outstanding centerpieces at party buffet tables. --Mark Knoblauch</p><h2>The Joy of Advent: Daily Reflections from Pope Francis</h2><p>With prayerful reflections drawn from the words of Pope Francis, this Advent companion helps you prepare for the Christmas season.

By opening this book, you agree with and understand this fact and are okay with it.<br><br> With that said, welcome! Hi. Thank you for buying this book. (Or are you reading this at the book store, like a creep? Being all <i>Hmmmmm what is this . . . I&#x2019;ll just have a free read. </i>Freeloader.) This book&#x2019;s about history, but not the type you are used to encountering. Sure, you may have heard of one or two of these stories, but by the end of this book, you will have a different perspective on America. Probably a conflicted one.<br><br>Now for <i>our </i>history. For us, the discovery of America&#x2019;s hilariously absurd past started with our podcast: <i>The Dollop</i>. For those of you who don&#x2019;t know what a podcast is, it&#x2019;s like a radio show that you can . . . oh, just Google it. We, Dave Anthony and Gareth Reynolds, met in Los Angeles on a mutual friend&#x2019;s podcast (you should have Googled what podcasts are by now) and didn&#x2019;t talk for a year after that. When Dave had the idea of doing an American history podcast, he knew exactly who to call: Chris Rock. Dave didn&#x2019;t know Chris personally, but he was a big fan. Chris had done so many things Dave admired. Unfortunately, Chris&#x2019;s busy schedule wouldn&#x2019;t permit his joining such an undertaking. Dave then talked to Sarah Silverman, but she was on location with a film. Next was Louis C.K., but that was a reach. Dave Chappelle, Dwayne &#x201c;the Rock&#x201d; Johnson, the guy who sells Flex Seal on TV, Ira Glass, Amy Schumer . . . they were all really busy. Dave then turned to Gareth, who was ready and available. And <i>The Dollop </i>was born! We began meeting to discuss tales from United States history that were apeshit.<br><br>We quickly discovered that not only were these tales interesting to us, but others were drawn to the information as well. We started to build a following whose members all wanted to know the same thing: <i>How have I never heard of this shit before?!? </i>In a way, American history is like report cards. The good ones go on the fridge to be boasted over; the bad get tossed in the trash and we pretend like they never happened. Regardless, these tales will not only show you how insane American history is, but also reveal how much this country loves alcohol. God, we love alcohol. So much. Like at a crazy level. The anecdotes ahead contain the stuff they <i>should </i>have taught you in history class. If class consisted of a teacher telling you how we discovered the lobotomy or learned how stomach acids work, or about the time a lady lived with a dolphin, just how Elvis became a federal agent, or even why meat rained down from the skies in Kentucky one day, school would have been way less terrible. America has been fucked up since Christopher Columbus set foot on this occupied land and claimed he discovered it. Yes, we really have a fascinating past, but for some reason we don&#x2019;t discuss it. So let&#x2019;s!<br><br>With this book, we&#x2019;ve got two aims: (1) winning a Pulitzer Prize and (2) sharing this absurdity with you. While one of these goals may be lofty, we think the Pulitzer is a slam dunk. No way we don&#x2019;t win that. Anyway, enjoy the book and discovering that you <i>do </i>actually enjoy history. Or just put it down already if you&#x2019;re still reading it at the bookstore. Seriously.

He recognizes his responsibility, not only to the sick who are under his direct care, but also to the community in which he lives. He stands as a guardian of both physical and moral health. It is his endeavor not only to teach right methods for the treatment of the sick, but to encourage right habits of living, and to spread a knowledge of right principles.Need of Education in Health PrinciplesEducation in health principles was never more needed than now. Notwithstanding the wonderful progress in so many lines relating to the comforts and conveniences of life, even to sanitary matters and to the treatment of disease, the decline in physical vigor and power of endurance is alarming. It demands the attention of all who have at heart the well-being of their fellow men.Our artificial civilization is encouraging evils destructive of sound principles. Custom and fashion are at war with nature. The practices they enjoin, and the indulgences they foster, are steadily lessening both physical and mental strength, and bringing upon the race an intolerable burden. Intemperance and crime, disease and wretchedness, are everywhere.</p><p>Ellen G. White was a co-founder of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Born in 1827 in Gorham, Maine, her spiritual calling began at an early age. For the remainder of her life, she conducted a public ministry, spreading her revolutionary Christian thinking around the country and the world. In 1863, the Seventh-day Adventist Church was established and she became its first spiritual leader. Through her inspired guidance, what began as a handful of believers has grown to include millions of followers throughout the world.The True Medical Missionary Our Example Days of Ministry With Nature and With God Th e Touch of Faith Healing of the Soul Saved to Serve Th e Work of the Physician Th e Co-Working of the Divine and the Human Th e Physician, an Educator Medical Missionaries and their Work Teaching and Healing Helping the Tempted Working for the Intemperate Help for the Unemployed and the Homeless Th e Helpless Poor Ministry to the Rich The Care of the Sick In the Sickroom Prayer for the Sick The Use of Remedies Mind Cure In Contact with Nature Health Principles General Hygiene Hygiene Among the Israelites Dress Diet and Health Flesh as Food Extremes in Diet Stimulants and Narcotics Liquor Traffi c and Prohibition The Home Ministry of the Home The Builders of the Home Choice and Preparation of the Home The Mother The Child Home Infl uences True Education, A Missionary Training The Essential Knowledge A True Knowledge of God Danger in Speculative Knowledge Th e False and the True in Education Th e Importance of Seeking True Knowledge Th e Knowledge Received Th rough God&#39;s Word The Worker&#39;s Need Help in Daily Living In Contact With Others Development and Service A Higher Experience</p><h2>I Am: The Names of God for Little Ones</h2><p><p><strong>God is the Creator, the Healer, our Savior, and our Friend.

But the kids want Mom to join in their fun, so they follow her wherever she goes! <br><br> With a relatable dilemma and hilarious art, Five Minutes' Peace is a favorite among moms, and this new format will make it the perfect baby gift.</p><p><b>Jill Murphy</b> lives in Cornwall, England.PreSchool-Grade 2 Mrs. Large determines to have just five minutes' peace from the mess and confusion of her beloved children. She fixes herself a tray, runs a tub of lovely warm water, fills it with bubble bath, and hopes for those precious moments alone before facing the day's activities. The ``activities'' follow her to the bathroom, where, one by one, they present her with their special talents of playing the recorder, reading aloud, and dumping favorite toys from the toy box into the tub with her. When all three children climb in, Mrs. Large decides, with a groan and resignation, that she will try for five minutes' peace in the kitchen. Cheerfully bright watercolor illustrations depict this endearing elephant family with distinctive humor and expression, totally complementing the text on companion pages. However, while the text is simplistic enough for primary readers, the humorous depiction of a beleaguered mother is adult-oriented. Some children may wonder why Mrs. Large wants to get away from her children. Nevertheless, a hearty chuckle can be experienced during a shared reading time between a mother and her childrenperhaps eliciting a bit of understanding.

Stretch and flex your mental muscles with Thinkpak, a creative-thinking tool designed by Michael Michalko, author of the groundbreaking book Thinkertoys. This deck of illustrated idea-stimulating cards distills Michalko&#x2019;s proven methods, allowing you to view challenges in a new light. Shuffle, mix, and match the cards to spark fresh insights, then use the critical evaluation techniques to test, shape, and refine your original ideas into realistic creations. Filled with thought-provoking questions and examples of the techniques put to use, Thinkpak provides endless creative fuel to fire up the imagination.</p><p>This is a new edition of the highly popular brainstorming cards based on one of Michael Michalko&#39;s creative thinking techniques. Michael is the author of &#34;Thinkertoys&#34; and &#34;Cracking Creativity.&#34;Have you ever tried to get a new idea simply by choosing to have one? Spend a few minutes and see how many new ways you can think of to sell your product. How did you do? If you're like most of us, you probably had difficulty coming up with more than a few. Our minds generally don't cooperate in such matters. It is very hard for us to simply will new ideas without some kind of intermediate step. But it's a snap, by comparison, to generate new ideas, solutions, breakthroughs, or whatever you need when you use a checklist of idea-spurring questions. <p>Thinkpak contains a checklist of idea-spurring questions based on "Scamper" a technique from my book Thinkertoys and the work of Alex Osborn, a pioneer teacher of creativity and father of brainstorming. Everything new is some manipulation of something that already exists. To create something new (idea, product, service, process, or whatever you need), all you need do is take a subject, and manipulate it in some fashion. There are nine principle ways to manipulate a subject and the Thinkpak cards reflect all nine ways. </p><p>The cards give conscious direction to your creativity. Instead of trying to juggle several concepts in your mind, hoping that an idea will somehow magically appear, the cards focus your imagination on the subject in a different way and will give you a different way to interpret what you&#x2019;re focusing on.</p></p><h2>Secret Garden: 20 Postcards</h2><p>Containing 20 detachable postcards of Johanna Basford's beautiful drawings from the inky world of her <em>Secret Garden</em>.

Last week, Tommy Lee was my fianc�. This week, he&#x2019;s married. To Pamela Anderson.<br> <br>It was February 1995, and in the aftermath of Tommy&#x2019;s shotgun wedding on the beach in Canc�n, four days after our breakup, my coping strategy was twofold.<br> <br>1. Get high.<br> <br>I had a line on some of the dopest trucker speed in Malibu. It was a killer buzz, lasting for days&#x2014;back in 1995, the meth was clean as a bean. I had been secretly using throughout my relationship with Tommy, as a way to maintain the rail-thin Barbie-doll figure that Tommy liked, and as a way to escape the growing sense that my life was fucked-up, on all levels. Very few people knew about my little problem, even though my pupils were dilated in broad daylight and I shouted at invisible dogs. I drove to the corner store for soda, came back eight hours later with gardening tools. My glitter gun became my best friend as I embarked on endlessly elaborate middle-of-the-night crafting projects, just to give my racing mind something to focus on. I was spun, a member of a long-established club known as the &#x201c;Hollywood Speed Freak Society&#x201d;&#x2014;a long line of celebrity tweakers who, like me, were afflicted by a cursed disposition for that unsavory mistress, methamphetamine.<br> <br>2. Get even.<br> <br>A few years prior, a voodoo doctor in my native Louisiana had warned me about messing with revenge. Dark energy, he said, &#x201c;will come back and bite you.&#x201d; But after seven years of having my heart shredded by Sunset Strip cock rockers, I wanted to teach those assholes a lesson. I&#x2019;m going to flip the script, treat the guys the way they treat us, I thought. I had reached my tipping point. I was ripe for revenge.<br> <br>I looked in the mirror. Twenty-six years old. My peroxide mane was messy; my roots were showing. I was Courtney Love meets Malibu Barbie, with the gaunt yet chic figure of a runway model&#x2014;around ninety-five pounds on a fat day. Thank you, crystal. The world knew me as Bobbie Brown, fianc�e of Tommy Lee, ex-wife of Jani Lane, cutie-patootie from the &#x201c;Cherry Pie&#x201d; video on MTV. They&#x2019;d yet to experience Bobbie Brown, wrathful, world-weary drug addict with no pride left to lose. I put on lipstick, a Wonderbra, and some assless chaps. I was ready to hit the clubs.<br> <br>After a year playing Malibu Rapunzel, holed up in Tommy Lee&#x2019;s beachfront fortress, I couldn&#x2019;t wait to fall back into Hollywood&#x2019;s welcoming arms. I had always been a club kid. I loved the darkness, the anonymity, the feeling of being underground. The velvet ropes that melted as soon as I arrived. Tommy may have tossed me aside, but in clubland, I was still queen.<br> <br>In 1995, Thursday nights at Grand Ville were where it was at. The club was a hub of the &#x2019;90s neo-burlesque scene, full of corseted girls with shoe-polish-black hair, a whirl of rhinestones, glitter, and feathers. Grand Ville was the toughest door in town, but the promoter, Rick Calamaro, a dear friend of mine (may he rest in peace), always greeted me with a smile.<br> <br>&#x201c;Welcome back, Bobbie.&#x201d;<br> <br>I stepped inside, through the looking glass, and into a different reality. A pleasure dome, decadent and carnivalesque. Everywhere I turned, I saw the ghosts of my past loves. There were the Tommy Lees&#x2014;wild, tattooed romantics, who turn mean when the roses wilt. The Jani Lanes&#x2014;sweet, tortured artists weighed down by their demons. The Matthew Nelsons&#x2014;blond angels destined to fly away. The exes in my life are no different to the exes in any girl&#x2019;s life&#x2014;except mine all happened to be rock stars.<br> <br>Who better to confide in about my problems than a wide-eyed actor named Leonardo DiCaprio, who had about as much life experience as a Care Bear? &#x201c;Thing is,&#x201d; I told him as we chatted at the club, &#x201c;if you&#x2019;re not grown-up enough to deal with their &#x2018;musician issues,&#x2019; then rock star lovers can send a girl down some very dark and dangerous rabbit holes. You know what I mean?&#x201d;<br> <br>Leo did not know what I meant. We were in the VIP lounge at Grand Ville, and he was looking at me like I was insane. I was insane, kind of. The stress of being married to one rock star (Jani Lane), engaged to another (Tommy Lee), and then jilted thanks to my professional rival (Pamela Anderson) had taken a toll. I was tired, jaded, defeated. The speed was playing tricks on my sanity, and my behavior had grown notoriously unpredictable. But how could Leo possibly understand? He was so fresh and upbeat. He looked like he should be drinking milk, not martinis.<br> <br>For years Leo had been dancing up to me at the clubs, saying how he wanted to make me his girlfriend. I smiled and patted him on the head. How cute. I was seven years his senior and felt like his grandma. I&#x2019;d never been someone&#x2019;s G.I.L.F. before. &#x201c;Do you think it&#x2019;s too Harold and Maude if I do it with Leo?&#x201d; I asked Sharise Neil, ex-wife of M�tley Cr�e&#x2019;s Vince Neil, and my sister in pleasure seeking. Sharise raised an eyebrow and shrugged. At least baby-faced Leo had a grown-up career, I thought. The Basketball Diaries, his breakthrough movie, had come out that year, and he was about to star in Baz Luhrmann&#x2019;s Romeo + Juliet. If I hooked up with Leo, who was younger, cuter, and about to be more famous than Tommy Lee, it would hit Tommy right in the ballsack.<br> <br>This time, when Leo came dancing up to me, I played along. &#x201c;Call me, I dare you.&#x201d; My inner G.I.L.F. was ready to party.<br> UNICORNS AND UNIBROWS<p></p> <br>I opened my front door, and there he was, wide face, cornflower-blue eyes, big smile. Leo&#x2019;s hair was pulled back in barrettes and he was wearing a headband. He looked pretty, like a ballerina. I invited him in. &#x201c;Can I put on some music?&#x201d; he asked, waving a CD in the air.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d;<br> <br>Don&#x2019;t go chasing waterfalls.<br> <br>Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you&#x2019;re used to.<br> <br>Leo sat on the floor, eyes closed, singing along. I recognized the song, by that R &amp; B girl band TLC. It was all over the radio. I stood there for a while, watching Leo sing along, wondering what to do next, and what conversation there was to make. There was none. Pok�mon? New Kids on the Block? College? &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go to the bedroom.&#x201d; I said. Leo nodded.<br> <br>My bed was big and tall, and you had to climb up a small ladder to get to it. &#x201c;You want to get up there with me, Leo?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay!&#x201d;<br> <br>We started kissing. I pulled his T-shirt over his head, leaving the barrettes in his hair. I unbuttoned his jeans and tugged down on his boxers. What I saw made me gasp. It made no sense. The kid put Tommy Lee to shame. &#x201c;Wow, Leo, I wasn&#x2019;t expecting that.&#x201d; Next to his slim body, his assets were startlingly huge. &#x201c;Wait, let me turn the light on,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got to see this properly.&#x201d; Yup, even under closer inspection, Leonardo DiCaprio&#x2019;s crotch was on steroids. I couldn&#x2019;t take my eyes off it. Ha, wait till Tommy &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got the biggest dick in Hollywood&#x201d; hears about this, I thought.<br> <br>&#x201c;So, Bobbie, do you have any diseases?&#x201d;<br> <br>Oh.<br> <br>The question dropped like ice water on my head. I hadn&#x2019;t really thought about it. I&#x2019;d come of age on the Sunset Strip, which was basically a glorified STD factory. No one in the rock scene wore condoms. No one. Had I been tested? Of course not. Nothing seemed too diseased down there, but I hadn&#x2019;t thought to ask a doctor to check me out. On the Strip, when it came to bodily juices, sharing was caring.<br> <br>&#x201c;Also, Bobbie, what about gonorrhea? Have you been tested for that? And when you suck my dick, can you do it with a condom on?&#x201d; Gah, he&#x2019;s so PC, I thought.<br> <br>Truth be told, I could hardly blame Leo for feeling the safe-sex vibe with me. Tommy Lee was one of the biggest man-whore stripper chasers on the Strip. But I had never sucked anyone&#x2019;s wiener with a condom on it before. Oh well, first time for everything.<br> <br>Leo rolled a rubber on, lay back, and closed his eyes. My cue to get started. I kissed his belly and drew him close to me. I began to lick and kiss his gargantuan penis. I tried to put it in my mouth. I could barely breathe. My jaw locked; my eyeballs bulged. So I went back to licking it. Unfortunately, the latex tasted like the inside of a balloon, bitter, reminiscent of trips to the dentist. I rode my tongue up and down, trying to ignore the acrid taste, but after a few minutes, I had to stop. The flavor, along with his spectacular girthyness, was making me gag.<br> <br>&#x201c;Leo, I&#x2019;m sorry but this condom tastes terrible. I don&#x2019;t think I can do it.&#x201d; Leo pulled me down next to him and kissed me sweetly. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right, that does taste kinda funny.&#x201d; I pulled him on top of me. His eyes stayed open, gazing into mine. His brow furrowed a little as he eased himself into me. I inhaled sharply&#x2014;he was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. titanic.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wow, Leo, that&#x2019;s nice, really nice.&#x201d; Waves of satisfaction rippled through my body. I pulled Leo deeper into me, as deep as he could go. Revenge was sweeter than I could have imagined. If only Tommy Lee could see me now.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wait. Wait a second. Don&#x2019;t move, Bobbie,&#x201d; whispered Leo.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We need to slow down.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Um, okay.&#x201d;<br> <br>We were about one minute into the lovemaking. I waited a few beats. I pulled him close again and he squeaked.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, no, not yet.&#x201d;<br> <br>I looked at Leo&#x2019;s perfect face as he grimaced, hoping to make it past the two-minute mark. He was a unicorn. Rare, innocent, and horny. Me, on the other hand, I&#x2019;d been engaged, married, and had given birth. I needed a man, not a man-child.<br> <br>Ah what&#x2019;s the point?<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to get a drink,&#x201d; I said, pushing him off me, climbing down out of the bed, throwing on a T-shirt. I was mad at him, mad at the whole world. The speed was making me antsy, bitchy, and annoyed with the handsome young golden boy for making me feel like a pedophile. Heading down the stairs, I yelled over my shoulder. &#x201c;Maybe you should take your socks off next time.&#x201d; Leo seemed confused. &#x201c;Okay&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. can you make me a drink too?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How about a glass of milk?&#x201d;<br> <br>I went downstairs and hung out by myself, watching TV. I just wanted him gone. &#x201c;Bobbie? Are you coming back?&#x201d; I heard him call from my bedroom.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nah.&#x201d;<br> <br>Leo, at his tender age, had yet to learn how to recognize damaged goods. How was he to know he was just one in a series of revenge fucks? A little confused by my behavior, Leo got up, got dressed, and left.<br> <br>A few months later, I did an interview on the radio in which I mentioned Leo&#x2019;s extraordinary penis. Leo, apparently, didn&#x2019;t see the funny side. He sent his best friend Kevin Connolly, who you might have seen on Entourage and in the movie He&#x2019;s Just Not That Into You, over to talk to me. Kevin was a mutual friend of ours who I talked to on the phone occasionally, and who had also asked me out a few times. Today, though, he was visiting on &#x201c;official business.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, so Leo heard about that interview you did,&#x201d; said Kevin. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s really pissed off that you would talk about something personal on-air.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; I said, stifling my laughter. I couldn&#x2019;t imagine Tommy ever getting mad about the world knowing what a huge penis he has. But then, Leo wasn&#x2019;t a cock-rock musician. For all his playfulness, he was a serious kid. I never heard from him again. Which was fine by me.<br> <br>Next!<br> <br>A few weeks later, the actor Stephen Dorff sidled up to me on the dance floor at Grand Ville, with an entourage of about six dudes. Wow, he really thinks he&#x2019;s the shit. I towered over him in my heels and had to bend down to hear what he was saying.<br> <br>&#x201c;So, you wanna go back to my house and fuck?&#x201d; said Stephen, in my ear. No hello, no &#x201c;how are you?&#x201d; Just straight to business.<br> <br>&#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d;<br> <br>He leaned in a little closer, and I could feel his spit on my cheek.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you want to go back to my place?&#x201d;<br> <br>You picked the wrong ice queen, motherfucker, I thought. I hit him with the most withering up-and-down stare I could muster and proceeded to tear him a new one.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, first of all, you&#x2019;re short. Second of all, you&#x2019;re fat. And third of all, you have a fucking unibrow.&#x201d; I made a unibrow above my nose with two fingers, to illustrate. &#x201c;Oh, and you&#x2019;re spitting on me. Can you back the fuck up? Yeah, get out of here, chubby.&#x201d;<br> <br>Damn. After all these years of being fun, goofy Bobbie Brown, unleashing my inner asshole felt good. Damn the consequences&#x2014;these guys had it coming. Thanks to the heart-numbing properties of the speed I was on, I had no mercy. Stephen turned to his entourage, stunned. &#x201c;Come on, guys, let&#x2019;s go.&#x201d; Sharise, who had seen the whole encounter, was about to die of laughter. &#x201c;What a dork!&#x201d; she giggled. Fresh off her divorce from Vince, she was as disillusioned with men as I was. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s show those assholes,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>Next stop, Kevin Costner&#x2019;s house. I looked around the party&#x2014;five guys and about a hundred girls. I wandered through the house and peered into a bedroom. Kevin was sitting on the bed, encircled by females. Oh, please, I thought.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on in,&#x201d; he said, smiling.<br> <br>I sat down on the bed. The girl sitting next to me put her legs around her neck. One leg, and then the other.<br> <br>&#x201c;This one&#x2019;s a sure thing,&#x201d; I said, rolling my eyes. Kevin seemed amused. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re funny,&#x201d; he said. He asked me for my number, and as I jotted down my digits on a napkin, I giggled privately. Mwa-ha-ha-ha. If only Kevin knew what he was about to get himself into. He called me the next night. &#x201c;Hey, Bobbie, are you in front of your TV? Check out channel five.&#x201d; I put it on. Dances with Wolves. &#x201c;Well, hi&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there you are.&#x201d; My eyes rolled deep into the back of my head.<br> <br>&#x201c;You girls should come to a party in Malibu this weekend. There will be music and dancing. You&#x2019;ll love it.&#x201d; I wasn&#x2019;t sure I could be bothered. Kevin&#x2019;s over-earnest egotism was turning me off, but Sharise wanted to go. Ah, fuck it. Ready for a good time, we made the hour&#x2019;s drive to Malibu from her house in the Valley, singing Sheryl Crow songs all the way.<br> <br>Malibu&#x2019;s twenty-seven-mile stretch of sun-drenched coastline is home to Mel Gibson, Steven Spielberg, Courteney Cox, and dotted with glassy million-dollar homes that stare out at the surf. But behind the elegant fa�ades lies the same hedonistic, morally bankrupt scene you&#x2019;ll find in Hollywood&#x2014;guys in Ferraris, strung-out Bel Air wives, rockers in cowboy boots, dust clouds of cocaine in their wake. Idiots, I thought, taking a quick key bump of speed in the car. I hated coke. Coke was for losers.<br> <br>Sharise and I walked into the party and headed straight for the dance floor. The DJ was spinning some rad hip-hop, and thanks to the speed, I had plenty of energy. I tuned into the rhythm, oblivious to the curious gazes of the other partygoers as Sharise and I busted out our raddest &#x2019;90s dance moves, pop-locking, voguing, and doing the Running Man like it was going out of style (which it was). Then I felt something behind me; it was Kevin, dancing up to me, awkward mating ritual in full effect. Imagine someone being led by his penis in a pelvic thrust, off the beat, headed in your direction. Instinctively, I shoved him with both arms across the dance floor.<br> <br>&#x201c;Whoa,&#x201d; said Kevin, stumbling. Undeterred, he came back at me with that pelvis.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you go dance somewhere else?&#x201d; I sniped.<br> <br>Sharise told me to stop being a bitch. I&#x2019;ll admit, I was kind of an asshole back in those days. I was not impressed by anybody or anything, no matter how many Oscars or Grammys they might h...</p><h2>HTML5 and CSS3 All-in-One For Dummies</h2><p><p><b>A new edition of a bestseller covers the latest advances in web development!</b></p> <p>HTML5 and CSS3 are essential tools for creating dynamic websites and boast updates and enhanced features that can make your websites even more effective and unique.

Get your food storage. But if you're just starting out, there's a problem with that advice....&nbsp;<br> WHERE DO YOU START?&nbsp;<br> Ever wish you could get the Cliff notes for food storage? You know, just go straight to what works, and forget everything else? Well here's your chance! <br> We'll help you quickly decipher what you should and should not be storing, share with you space saving tricks and insider information to save you $1,000s of dollars when buying your food storage, and in the end, how to make something your family would actually eat!</p><p>I bought this book on preparedness. It is easy to follow and has lots of good information for breaking this daunting task into manageble segments. I'd recommend this book to anyone beginning a food storage program. It will save you many mistakes and money! --Amazon<br><br>I just got this book yesterday and have done a quick review of it. After being involved in food storage for over forty years I find this to be the simplest and most comprehensive approach. It shows how to do it quickly, easily and relatively inexpensively. I know that having three months worth of food that we can eat on an everyday basis is the best approach for the many challenges that we face in our modern world. Having experienced downturns I know how comforting not having to worry about where your next meal is coming from is. Thanks for the book and its many pieces of advice and help. --Amazon<br><br>I have studied up on food storage quite a bit and so there was a good portion of this stuff that I already knew but there were things throughout the book that I didn't know or hadn't thought about so that was helpful. There are also recipes in there which I didn't realize were going to be there, so that was a bonus. Some of them aren't as much recipes as they are ideas (example: alfredo pasta=jar of alfredo plus pasta. It's a great food storage idea if you like that jarred stuff but we don't). Some of the other recipes had things like Betty Crocker's au gratin potato's box and we try to do homemade to avoid the extra unwanted stuff that those ready made things have. There are still a fair amount of recipes to try that don't have boxed/jarred things so we'll be trying those out. It's hard to know how convenient to make food storage because homemade takes time but it's more healthy and store bought stuff takes less time but doesn't have much to offer for the healthy factor (or taste and flavor). --Amazon</p><h2>The Middle Ages: An Interactive History Adventure (You Choose: Historical Eras)</h2><p>Capstone&#39;s best-selling You Choose format, set in the Middle Ages.

Allison lives in Trenton, Tennessee with her husband, daughter, and a houseful of pets.Each book in the You Choose: Historical Eras series begins with an overview of the time period to be covered. Over the next two or three chapters, readers make choices in roles such as an Egyptian tomb painter, Greek philosopher, wealthy Roman woman, or medieval knight. Many choices in these books lead to gory death: &#x201c;The only way anyone will know that you are dead is when they smell your rotting body,&#x201d; concludes one scenario in The Middle Ages. While not everything rings true (a character refers to a litter of kittens as &#x201c;cute&#x201d;), a final chapter and time line add context and bolster the factual information in each book. Full-color illustrations and photos appear throughout, and back matter includes an index, bibliography, and glossary, as well as suggestions for additional reading. A page of discussion and research questions further extend the topics. The interactive format and suspenseful scenarios will hit the mark with middle-graders and especially reluctant readers.

Learn how to recognize and correct Airway-Centered Disorders, Sleep-Disordered Breathing. Gasp is about our airway, breathing and sleep. Problems can start at birth. Many premature babies are mouth breathers. A poorly structured and functioning airway leads to mouth breathing, snoring and sleep apnea; it can interfere with restorative sleep and ultimately damage the part of the brain called the prefrontal cortex, which controls executive function skills, attentiveness, anxiety and depression. Learn how to restore an ideal airway with early intervention, and where to go for help. Learn how once the airway is established with breastfeeding, allergy treatment, and other methods, neurocognitive and neurobehavioral problems are greatly improved&#x2014;often without any medication. Anxiety and depression are alleviated, and the behavior and performance of children are remarkably transformed. Today there is a health movement toward &#x201c;Wellness.&#x201d; Wellness is about diet and nutrition, exercise, and mental attitude. The new paradigm is called &#x201c;Functional Medicine.&#x201d; It addresses the causes of chronic disease with an individualized approach and emphasizes early intervention. It restores the balance amongst functional systems and the networks that connect them. The missing link is airway, breathing, and sleep. If we don&#x2019;t breathe well when we sleep, 1/3 of our life is affected. Gasp describes the impact of a narrowed airway from cradle to grave. Every day, we encounter fatigued patients with chronic headaches and neck pain. They have difficulty concentrating; they suffer with GI problems from acid reflux to irritable bowel syndrome. They range from thin women to men who have put on a few pounds. And you do not have to be obese to have an airway problem. Many of our younger patients with ADHD and airway issues have little body fat. Time after time we see that once the airway is opened during the day and maintained during sleep, the transformation is quick and dramatic. Breathing is life.</p><p>Michael Gelb, DDS, MS: Dr Michael Gelb is an innovator in airway, breathing, sleep, and painful TMJ disorders pioneering Airway Centric�.

I have only ever been on one field trip before&#x2014;we went to the ballet&#x2014;so I was very excited when our teacher, Miss Cherry, said that we would be going on another one! <br> &#x201c;Oh, lovely,&#x201d; said Mom when I brought the permission slip home. &#x201c;A historic castle museum! That will be interesting. Would you like Dad and me to volunteer again?&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Um . . . ,&#x201d; I began. Mom and Dad had volunteered on my last field trip and it had been fine (mostly), but I am always a little unsure about them offering to help out. The thing is that my mom is a fairy and my dad is a vampire (which makes me a vampire-fairy, by the way). They are not like other parents, and sometimes it can be embarrassing. <br> &#x201c;You can,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;If you really want to. Except Miss Cherry said they only need one volunteer this time. So only one of you can come.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; said Mom, looking slightly disappointed. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a shame. Your dad should go, then. You know how much he loves old castles!&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;I do!&#x201d; agreed Dad, who was bouncing my baby sister, Honeyblossom, up and down. &#x201c;I would love to go!&#x201d; He whipped a pen out from underneath his cloak and briskly signed the letter. <br> &#x201c;I hope I will get to wear one of those fashionable safety vests again,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It was a very striking look.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; agreed Mom. &#x201c;You did look handsome in it. They were nice and bright, weren&#x2019;t they? I think the word for that is &#x2018;fluorescent.&#x2019;&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Fluorescent!&#x201d; said Dad. &#x201c;I love that word!&#x201d; He handed the letter back to me. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t wait for the trip!&#x201d; he exclaimed. &#x201c;Old castles are the best. Do you think it will be haunted? I hope so!&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; I replied. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have to ask Miss Cherry.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Haunted?!&#x201d; said Miss Cherry in surprise when I asked her the question the next day at school. &#x201c;Of course the castle won&#x2019;t be haunted! You shouldn&#x2019;t be worried about that!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not worried,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I just&#x2014;&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Haunted?&#x201d; asked my friend Zoe. &#x201c;Did you say the castle was haunted, Isadora?&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;No, I was just&#x2014;&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s haunted!&#x201d; cried Zoe loudly, putting her hand over her mouth in shock. &#x201c;Oh my goodness!&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Eek!&#x201d; cried Samantha, wide-eyed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m scared of ghosts!&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Everyone&#x2019;s scared of ghosts!&#x201d; said Bruno. <br> &#x201c;The castle is haunted!&#x201d; shouted Jasper. <br> Soon the whole class was in an uproar. Samantha&#x2019;s face had gone very white. <br> &#x201c;Now, calm down, everyone,&#x201d; said Miss Cherry loudly. &#x201c;The castle is NOT haunted.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;But what if it is?&#x201d; squeaked Samantha. <br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s NOT,&#x201d; sighed Miss Cherry, rolling her eyes. <br> But no one in the class was listening. The idea that the castle was haunted had firmly planted itself into everyone&#x2019;s head. <br> &#x201c;I bet the ghost wanders around the castle, wailing and moaning,&#x201d; said Zoe. <br> Sashi shivered. &#x201c;I bet it has red, glowing eyes and very sharp teeth.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I bet it eats children for breakfast,&#x201d; said Bruno. <br> &#x201c;Oh, help!&#x201d; gulped Samantha, trembling. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Now, Dad,&#x201d; I said the night before the school trip. &#x201c;I know you&#x2019;re a vampire, but you have to make sure you don&#x2019;t oversleep tomorrow. We need to be at school at nine o&#x2019;clock to catch the bus.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;A bus!&#x201d; said Dad. &#x201c;How exciting! I have never been on one of those before.&#x201d; <br> He patted my arm. &#x201c;And don&#x2019;t worry, Isadora, I will make sure I am ready. I am planning to set five extremely loud alarms. The first one will go off at five o&#x2019;clock. That will give me about two and a half hours to do my hair. It&#x2019;s not much, I know, but it will have to do.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Great!&#x201d; I said happily. &#x201c;Thanks, Dad.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Oh my,&#x201d; said Mom. &#x201c;Five alarms! I will have to magic up some special earplugs for myself tonight!&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, Mom,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You can sleep in my room tonight. We can set up the camp bed! Maybe we can even roast marshmallows, like we did when we went camping!&#x201d; <br> Mom laughed. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s very sweet of you, Isadora,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t mind really. It&#x2019;s nice to be awake at the crack of dawn sometimes. Nature is very beautiful in the early morning.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Oh, okay,&#x201d; I said, feeling a little bit disappointed. &#x201c;Could we still have some marshmallows, though? We could have them for dessert tonight!&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Great idea!&#x201d; said Mom, glancing out the window at the wet weather. &#x201c;I do love being out in the fresh, sparkling rain!&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Um . . . ,&#x201d; began Dad. <br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll use magic to make us a shelter,&#x201d; said Mom. &#x201c;That way the campfire won&#x2019;t go out.&#x201d; <br> Dad looked worried. He hates the rain because it messes up his perfectly groomed vampire hair.<br> &#x201c;Do you think we could cook the marshmallows indoors?&#x201d; he suggested. &#x201c;Over the stove?&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Oh, no!&#x201d; said Mom, horrified. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t want to miss this glorious weather!&#x201d; <br> Dad and I stared out the window at the darkening gray sky as Mom got things ready for the campfire. Rain was now pouring down in sheets. <br> &#x201c;I hope it will clear up for the trip tomorrow,&#x201d; said Dad. &#x201c;Otherwise we&#x2019;re going to get very wet.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure it will,&#x201d; said Mom confidently. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s probably just a little shower.&#x201d; <br> But we roasted our marshmallows under the magical shelter, and by the time we all went to bed, the rain was <i>still</i> hammering down on the roof of our house.</p><h2>Mega Man Zero: Official Complete Works</h2><p>The Mega Man Zero series is a fan-favorite Mega Man spin-off known for it's exciting gameplay, stellar character designs, and engaging story. <br> <br> Mega Man Zero: Official Complete Works collects the unique artwork of the series, and is filled with character designs, concept sketches, location artwork, key visuals, item charts, creator interviews, and more!

And Why the F-Factor Diet Is a Long-Term Solution<br><br> Thou shouldst eat to live; not live to eat.<br><br> -socrates (469 b.c.-399 b.c.)<br><br> You notice it at the beach.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You observe it in the fans at sporting events.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A quick look around the mall and there is no denying it: Americans are fatter than ever.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Currently, 70 percent of American adults are overweight, and half of them are obese. Yet merely three decades ago, less than 50 percent of the American population was overweight. As the years passed, somehow our waistlines kept expanding. It wouldn't be such a big deal if the problem were simply aesthetic. But excess weight correlates with increased risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, diabetes, infertility, gallbladder disease, osteoarthritis, and many forms of cancer. The Journal of the American Medical Association reported in 2004 that being overweight could soon overtake tobacco as the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. We clearly have reason to worry. <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A recent survey published in the National Institute of Public Health publication reports that, in the United States on any given day, 44 percent of men and almost 66 percent of women are trying to lose weight. Last year alone, Americans spent billions of dollars on weight-loss products, health club memberships, diet foods, liposuctions, and gastric bypass operations. And where did investments in these supposed panaceas get us? Despite our attempts to lose weight, this country's population is currently the heaviest it has ever been. Our individual weight problems have become a national crisis.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;After low-fat diets failed to put an end to the epidemic of obesity, low-carb diets appeared to be the solution to Americans' struggle with weight. We tried diets like Atkins and South Beach, and in doing so, cut out bread, fruit, milk, yogurt, and even vegetables in order to whittle down our waistlines. But after a decade of low-carb eating, the truth remains: Americans are fatter than ever.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The problem with low-carb diets is the same as with low-fat diets, and with the numerous other failed diets of the past: their focus is on eliminating foods in order to lose weight. Whether you are cutting out fat or carbohydrates, the result is that you end up craving the foods that have become taboo. Who wants to feel deprived of their favorite foods in order to maintain a desired weight? A life without bagels for breakfast, pasta at Italian restaurants, or rice with your Chinese food? That's crazy! And that is also why most diets are temporary.<br><br> How Did We Get So Fat?<br><br> The advent and growth of industrialization, jumbo portion sizes, and fad diets produced a predictable, understandable, and inevitable consequence-an epidemic of obesity and diet-related diseases.<br><br> Industrialization<br><br> You might equate industrialization with advancements in engineering, economy, and human resources. While sounding promising, industrialization applied to food processing has negatively affected Americans' nutrition.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Before industrialization, whole grains were left whole. Breads and rice were brown; fruits and vegetables were eaten just the way they came out of the ground or off the tree. These foods were nutritious, rich in vitamins, and full of fiber. Now, however, our supermarkets stock white bread, sweetened fruit drinks, and instant mashed potatoes-the legacy of agricultural industrialization that has left us in a fiber deficit.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The absence of fiber in Americans' diets is a major risk factor for weight gain. Despite the American Dietetic Association recommending that Americans eat 25 to 38 grams of fiber per day, the average American currently eats only 15 grams of fiber a day. Not eating enough fiber leads people to feel hungry and to overeat throughout the day.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Snacking contributes to one-fourth of Americans' daily caloric intake. And when we snack, what do we choose? Chips, cookies, crackers, sweetened beverages, and frozen desserts, all of which contain virtually no fiber. People who eat these foods to try to satisfy their appetites only find themselves hungry again soon after. Diets based on such refined foods create a vicious cycle of eating and hunger all day long.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To add insult to injury, refined foods are available everywhere, all of the time. Walk down the cookie or snack-chip aisles in your supermarket, and you find hundreds of choices. Delis, food courts, and vending machines present the opportunity to snack around the clock. Gas stations used to sell only gas-now they have been remodeled to house a food market inside. Going to the gas station no longer means just filling up your tank; it now is an opportunity to fill up your belly. An increase in convenience has provoked a shift to frequent "grazing"-eating small but cumulatively hefty snacks, as opposed to regular meals.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;As technological advances have made food ever more varied, convenient, and tasty, the feeble willpower of the American public has been unable to cope. Most people know the rule of thermodynamics: calories in versus calories out. If you eat more calories than you burn, you will gain weight. Americans are not only eating more (the average American consumes 2,640 calories a day, up from 1,970 calories in 1978), we are also moving less.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Technology has not only made food more varied and convenient, it has almost completely removed natural physical exercise from most Americans' day-to-day lives. In the early nineteenth century, if you wanted ice cream, you would have to walk out to the pasture, milk the cow, carry the milk back to the farmhouse, mix in sugar and eggs, add salt to the ice, and churn the whole thing for hours until it froze. A person would burn a few hundred calories in the process. Now if people crave ice cream, they only have to walk to the refrigerator or drive to the nearest convenience store for a pint of Ben &amp; Jerry's.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Cars, washing machines, elevators, escalators, and moving sidewalks at the airport have reduced physical exertion. Watching television for hours, sitting in front of a computer, and playing video games create the perfect recipe for weight gain.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Eating refined foods frequently and moving less are not the only problems. Ever-expanding food portions are also to blame.<br><br> Out-of-Control Portion Sizes<br><br> Advances in agriculture and farming followed industrialization. Never has food in this country been so abundant. This country produces 3,800 calories of food for every man, woman, and child every day-almost twice as many as most people need. The surplus of food translates into whopping portions at low prices, and Americans are eating them up. Larger portions seem to make consumers feel that they are getting their money's worth. And the food companies are responding.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;With the exception of sliced white bread, the sizes of sodas, hamburgers, French fries, pizza slices, and other foods commonly available for immediate consumption exceed standard portions determined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Cookies, cooked pastas, muffins, steaks, and bagels exceeded USDA standards by 700 percent, 480 percent, 333 percent, 224 percent, and 195 percent respectively.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the 1950s, McDonald's offered one size, a 2-ounce portion of French fries that contained 200 calories. Starting in 2004, the 2-ounce size was offered only on the kids' menu, and adults were offered a 7-ounce French fry serving with 610 calories. In 1997, Starbucks took the 8-ounce Short, its smallest size, off the menu when it introduced the 20-ounce Venti (the Extra Large). Now the 12-ounce Tall is the smallest choice. Larger portions are attractive to customers because the relative prices discourage the choice of smaller portions. How many times at the concession stand at the movies have you heard the vendor tell you that for a few cents more, you can get the next size up? Unfortunately, you are not just getting more value for your money; you are also getting more calories. A Coke and buttered popcorn combination has 688 calories, while a value pack (large Coke and buttered popcorn) has 2,174 calories (based on small popcorn serving size 5 cups; large popcorn serving size 20 cups; small Coke serving size 18 oz, large Coke serving size 44 oz).<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Bigger portions are everywhere. At fast-food joints and convenience stores, the trend is hard to miss-7-Eleven offers the 48-ounce Double Gulp, and the muffins at Au Bon Pain are the size of softballs. Not only have food portions increased but, according to the National Restaurant Association in Washington, D.C., our plates have grown, too. The 10-inch plate was once the industry standard; now 12-inch plates are the norm. Servings are so big that in some restaurants you get two or three times more than you need. A typical meal at an ordinary restaurant contains 1,200 calories, and that's without the dessert or appetizer.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;More calories equal more weight gain, pure and simple.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Larger restaurant portions have become an increased problem because Americans eat out more frequently than they used to. Twenty years ago, most people ate in restaurants only on special occasions. Today, the typical American eats out 4.5 times a week.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Larger portions have even entered our homes. Serving sizes in popular cookbooks, such as The Joy of Cooking, are getting "hearty" as well. In 1960, a brownie recipe in The Joy of Cooking yielded 30 brownies. Today, in its most current edition, the brownie recipe calls for exactly the same proportions as the original, but instead of the original 30-brownie yield, the recipe now yields only 16 brownies. That means each brownie is almost twice as big, with double the amount of calories as the original.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Even "diet" foods, including certain brands of frozen dinners, now come in larger sizes. For instance, in 1996, Stouffer's introduced a packaged food line called Lean Cuisine Hearty Portions that weighed 50 percent more than the original, and which of course had more calories.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The result of these larger portions is that Americans' conception of a serving has become skewed. Standard portion sizes recommended by the American Dietetic Association have become a thing of the past. Now when we are served a standard portion, it seems measly.<br><br> Fad Diets<br><br> The greater the prevalence of obesity, the more alluring is the latest fad diet promising fast and easy weight loss. American dieters' eagerness to find the magic weight-loss bullet has led them from no-fat diets to high-protein diets. The problem now is that many Americans no longer know what they should be eating.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In 1981, Americans were introduced to Dr. Atkins' Diet Revolution (Bantam). The diet was high-protein and high-fat with minimal carbohydrates. People lost weight but found a diet without carbohydrates difficult to maintain. In the late 1980s, studies from the American Heart Association reported that dietary fat increased the risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Americans took this information to heart, banished fat from their diets, and entered the fat-free decade of the 1990s. The 1990s introduced Americans to fat-free cookies, cakes, chips, and every food imaginable that could be remade without fat.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Americans loved the concept of fat-free foods because, unlike other diets that made you count calories, eating fat-free meant no calorie watching. If a food was fat-free, that was the green light to dig in! Americans began eating large bagels (no cream cheese), bowls of pasta (no cream or oil, just tomato sauce) and large quantities of fat-free pastries from companies like SnackWell's and Entenmann's.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For breakfast, instead of two eggs and a piece of buttered toast (265 calories, 15 grams fat), a fat-free dieter opted for a 1,000-calorie fat-free muffin. And for a snack, instead of eating two 100-calorie Oreo cookies with 5 grams of fat, people would eat half a box of SnackWell's cookies, which contained 400 calories, and no fat. Although they were eating more calories, people assumed that, since there was no fat, they could get away with it. Wow, were they fooled!<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Unfortunately, fat-free dieting led to more weight gain. By 1990, Americans were 6 percent heavier than a decade earlier. Calories appeared to be a major culprit. Despite the drop in fat intake, average calorie intake increased from 1,970 calories a day in 1978 to 2,200 in 1990.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Most fat-free product manufacturers replaced the fat in the recipes with sugar and starch. Many fat-free foods ended up with the same number of or even more calories than the full-fat original. And the biggest problem with eating fat-free foods is that a person never actually feels full or satisfied. That is because fat adds satiety to a meal. Without a little fat, you feel hungry soon after you finish eating. So people ate more, and eventually gained more weight. Once again, weight-conscious Americans were let down by another diet trend.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Trends come full circle. In response to the failure of fat-free diets, we returned to the high-fat, high-protein diets of the 1970s. The Atkins diet made a comeback, and low-carb foods quickly replaced all those now-condemned low-fat products on the supermarket shelves. We threw out the offending SnackWell's and replaced them with Atkins bars and Carb Smart ice cream. The late 1990s were spent eating steak, butter, bacon, and eggs. As long as there were no carbohydrates in a food, it was okay to eat it. Nevertheless, by the end of the '90s, despite cutting out carbohydrates, 64.5 percent of Americans were overweight, up from 44.8 percent in 1960.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The essential problem with diets is that people don't stay on them very long. The average weight-loss attempt is four weeks for women, six for men. So until you pick a way of eating that's going to last all your life, you haven't found the "right" diet.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;How many of you have gone on a very low calorie diet for, say, two weeks and lost 5 to 10 pounds? Whether you chose the Scarsdale diet, the grapefruit diet, the cabbage soup diet, Slimfast, or Atkins, eventually you were bound to be disappointed. That's because diets are a temporary solution to a lifelong problem.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When people reach their weight loss goal, many go off their diet. The first thing they end up eating are the foods they felt most deprived of. If they were on Atkins, they might go for a bowl of pasta or a bagel with cream cheese. If they were on a low-fat diet, they dive into high-fat items like steak and French fries.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Returning to our old eating habits invites the weight to come back. Once the weight returns, you find your...</p><h2>Prayers for Difficult Times: When You Don&#39;t Know What to Pray</h2><p><p>Here&#x2019;s a practical guide of short prayer starters that will help readers pray confidently during difficult times.

They became known as the Lost Boys. With little more than the clothes on their backs, sometimes not even that, they streamed out over Sudan in search of refuge. Their journey led them first to Ethiopia and then, driven back into Sudan, toward Kenya. They walked nearly one thousand miles, sustained only by the sheer will to live.<br><br><i>They Poured Fire on Us from the Sky</i> is the three boys' account of that unimaginable journey. With the candor and the purity of their child's-eye-vision, Alephonsian, Benjamin, and Benson recall by turns: how they endured the hunger and strength-sapping illnesses-dysentery, malaria, and yellow fever; how they dodged the life-threatening predators-lions, snakes, crocodiles and soldiers alike-that dogged their footsteps; and how they grappled with a war that threatened continually to overwhelm them. Their story is a lyrical, captivating, timeless portrait of a childhood hurled into wartime and how they had the good fortune and belief in themselves to survive.<br><br><b>Christopher Award Winner<br>Los Angeles Times Bestseller<br>Washington Post Top 100 Books of the Year Selection<br>Includes a Reading Group Guide</b><br><br></p><p><b>Alephonsion</b> and <b>Benson Deng</b> and their cousin <b>Benjamin Ajak</b> left the Sudan in 1987, and were relocated in 2001 from the Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya to the United States as part of an international refugee relief program.

As a renowned British historian and the author of numerous international bestsellers, including <i>Majesty</i>, his pioneering biography of Queen Elizabeth II, Lacey has been writing about the queen and her extraordinary life for more than forty years. He is the ideal companion to explain and reveal the secrets of her long reign.Preface<br><br>Suez, Scandal, Socialism &#x2014; and Tragedy at Aberfan<br><br><i>The Crown</i> moves on ... in the first volume of our <i>Inside History</i> we followed Queen Elizabeth II from her childhood through to love and marriage, savouring the hidden history of her coronation and her early years of apprenticeship with Winston Churchill &#x2013; as based on the first ten episodes (101&#x2013;110) of <i>The Crown</i> Season 1. <br><br>Now, in Seasons 2 and 3, the Queen must work with prime ministers who are shadows of the great man &#x2013; the devious Anthony Eden and Harold &#x2018;Supermac&#x2019; Macmillan, as well as with Alec Douglas-Home, whose mistakes paved the way for Harold Wilson, the most successful Labour Prime Minister of Elizabeth&#x2019;s reign. Twenty Netflix episodes (201&#x2013;210 and 301&#x2013;310) and 20 matching chapters (One to Twenty) of this book will transport us from the Suez Crisis of 1956 to the Silver Jubilee celebrations of 1977, a saga of intrigue, tragedy, more royal babies &#x2013; and, this being the Cold War, a surprising amount of trouble with <i>spies</i>. <br><br>This book, volume 2, tracks the history of the still-maturing Elizabeth II through the second phase of her reign as she feels her way towards more confident regality, while her country stumbles quite dramatically, losing hold of the self-assurance &#x2013; the smugness, indeed &#x2013; that characterised the British Establishment after the victory of the Second World War. In 1956 the Suez adventure put paid to London&#x2019;s pretensions that it ruled the world, while the Profumo Scandal of 1963 discredited the elite who liked to think that <i>they</i> ruled London. But from these misadventures emerged a more populist identity under the Labour governments of Harold Wilson &#x2013; for whom Elizabeth II developed something of a soft spot &#x2013; with the Swinging Sixties, divorce and homosexual law reform, the Beatles, miniskirts, England winning The World Cup ... <br><br>In one sense, the monarchy rode serenely &#x2013; and not a little superciliously &#x2013; above all these social and political changes. Elizabeth II, her critics complained, occupied a completely different universe from the &#x2018;Women&#x2019;s Lib&#x2019; movement that developed in the 1960s and 1970s &#x2013; and so she did. On the other hand, the antiquated British system of hereditary monarchy delivered supreme national prestige and authority to a woman throughout these tumultuous years, with an openmindedness and, yes, a modernity, that the contemporary United States still cannot bring itself to embrace. Every episode of <i>The Crown</i> (201&#x2013;310) &#x2013; and every chapter of our book (One to Twenty) &#x2013; plays with this delicious paradox: the sight of powerful men having to bow and kneel to an unremarkable mother of two (of four by the end of Season 2). <br><br>This second volume follows the first in attempting to separate history from invention. How much of the drama that viewers so enjoy in <i>The Crown</i> is historically &#x2018;true&#x2019;? And how much has series creator Peter Morgan invented? On several occasions we will follow Elizabeth II as she meets characters whom we are 99 per cent certain she cannot possibly have encountered in this way &#x2013; the rebel peer Lord Altrincham, for example, visiting Buckingham Palace after his dramatic criticisms of the monarchy, or Eileen Parker, the wife of Philip&#x2019;s friend Mike Parker, whom Elizabeth seeks out to discuss her marriage problems. No, dear viewer and reader, these encounters did <i>not</i> happen. But, yes, these dramatic inventions have been devised to embody the central themes and messages of the plot. Drama, remember, is not the same as documentary. <br><br>Peter Morgan does not write a word of <i>The Crown</i> until he has worked out a documented historical template for each episode with the series&#x2019; research team. Solid factual data &#x2013; letters, documents, newsreels and first-hand interviews with surviving participants and witnesses &#x2013; form the backbone and skeleton of every story. Then the writer and his fellow writers add dramatic flesh to the bones, creating a drama on screen that is a unique blend of real history and imagined truths &#x2013; as exemplified by the famous &#x2018;Stag Scene&#x2019; in <i>The Queen</i>, Peter Morgan&#x2019;s Oscar-winning movie of 2006. <br><br>Towards the climax of <i>The Queen</i>, which depicts the events following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in August 1997, we see Elizabeth II, played by Helen Mirren, lost in the Highlands of Scotland in the course of a deer hunt. Suddenly she catches sight of the deer, a magnificent Imperial stag, standing proudly on the river bank in front of her &#x2013; an&nbsp;embattled and harassed monarch just like her, pursued as she is at that moment by the media of the world who are condemning her for her apparent indifference to Diana&#x2019;s death. Elizabeth starts talking to the stag. She senses their common plight, and it pierces her to the quick. Stricken with anxiety as she hears the hunters approach, she then waves her arms and shoos the imperilled beast to run away to safety &#x2013; which he does. One minute he is there &#x2013; the next minute he is gone.&nbsp;<br><br>The &#x2018;Peter Morgan Stag Scene&#x2019; is taught in film schools around the world as an illustration of how sheer invention, plucked out of the air, is essential to make history performable. No one imagines that Queen Elizabeth II has ever spoken to a wild stag in her life. But it is the scene that people remember as summing up the essential truth of <i>The Queen</i> and conveying the totally accurate and historical message of the movie &#x2013; that if Diana was destroyed by the monarchy, her mother-in-law was another type of casualty.<br><br>Every episode of <i>The Crown</i> TV series has been imaginatively built in a similar fashion around a major historical event of the period &#x2013; from the Anglo-French-Israeli conspiracy behind the invasion of Suez in 1956 to the tragic deaths of 116 children and 28 adults in the Welsh mining village of Aberfan in 1966. The corresponding chapter in this book will seek to explain the different layers of that episode, analysing how research and interpretation have worked together to create the final dramatic mix.&nbsp;<br><br>In 1956, for example, only a few inner, top-level government conspirators knew the details of the plot that Britain and France hatched with Israel to create an excuse for invading the Suez Canal Zone. Similarly, in 1966 it took months to&nbsp;lay bare the shameful culpability of the National Coal Board in failing to monitor the waste tip that fatally smothered Aberfan&#x2019;s Pantglas Junior School.&nbsp;<br><br>So should the dramatist depict such episodes by working solely with the surface, contemporary knowledge and ignorance of the participants at the time? Or is the writer permitted to &#x2018;enrich&#x2019; the narrative with the benefit of hindsight? That debate provides a running tug-of-war through every chapter of this book &#x2013; enhanced by two illustrated colour picture sections that display <i>The Crown</i>&#x2019;s production stills &#x2013; reflecting the key scenes from Seasons 2 and 3. Has the screen version improved on history, or corrupted it? The question is there for the reader to decide.&nbsp;<br><br>Hilary Mantel, the historical novelist, has offered a profound and illuminating description of the difference between history and the past &#x2013; two very different horses, in her view, who are each of a contrasting colour. As she explained in her BBC Reith Lectures of 2017, the past is what <i>really existed </i>&#x2013; all the lives and loves and hopes and dreams of the billions and trillions of people who have lived and died on earth since time began. Then along comes the historian &#x2013; rather like a gardener, suggests Ms Mantel, who is holding out a sieve to try and capture any fragments of the past that might get caught in the mesh: the books and surviving documents, the monuments and artefacts that remain, along with the shards unearthed by the archaeologists.&nbsp;<br><br>These fragments make up &#x2018;history&#x2019; &#x2013; the comparatively few and often banal relics that survive in the sieve. But most of humanity&#x2019;s past, all those glorious personal dreams and loves, all the beautiful and creative emotions fizzing away inside&nbsp;people&#x2019;s heads and hearts for countless millennia &#x2013; all <i>that</i> precious reality has escaped history&#x2019;s mesh.&nbsp;<br><br>Poor historians! You can sense Ms Mantel&#x2019;s pity for the paper-shufflers who have missed out on the real life of the past through sticking to their stolid, fact-based approach. What a glorious opportunity for the historical novelist and screen writer to pounce upon all those treasures that have passed <i>through</i> the sieve, deploying their imaginations to recreate a drama that is both fictitious and true. <br><br>&#x2018;You got it all wrong and you got it all right,&#x2019; declared one of the Queen&#x2019;s private secretaries a year or so back when Peter Morgan invited him to pass judgement on the early seasons of <i>The Crown</i> &#x2013; and that is the theme examined in the pages that follow. History requires the magic of the dramatist&#x2019;s imagination in order to become performable &#x2013; which means, in the most basic sense, that the drama you see on screen is &#x2018;all wrong&#x2019;. <br><br>But when you take account of the human truths about the Queen and her family that have been confected and conveyed to you by <i>The Crown</i>, then the dazzling creation on the screen in front of you can certainly be judged to be &#x2018;all right&#x2019;. That is the paradox which this book now invites you to explore. <br><br>Robert Lacey <br>September 2019</p><h2>Creating Wicked Students: Designing Courses for a Complex World</h2><p>In <i>Creating Wicked Students</i>, Paul Hanstedt argues that courses can and should be designed to present students with what are known as &#x201c;wicked problems&#x201d; because the skills of dealing with such knotty problems are what will best prepare them for life after college. As the author puts it, &#x201c;this book begins with the assumption that what we all want for our students is that they be capable of changing the world....When a student leaves college, we want them to enter the world not as drones participating mindlessly in activities to which they&#x2019;ve been appointed, but as thinking, deliberative beings who add something to society.&#x201d;<br><br>There&#x2019;s a lot of talk in education these days about &#x201c;wicked problems&#x201d;&#x2015;problems that defy traditional expectations or knowledge, problems that evolve over time: Zika, ISIS, political discourse in the era of social media. To prepare students for such wicked problems, they need to have wicked competencies, the ability to respond easily and on the fly to complex challenges. Unfortunately, a traditional education that focuses on content and skills often fails to achieve this sense of wickedness. Students memorize for the test, prepare for the paper, practice the various algorithms over and over again&#x2015;but when the parameters or dynamics of the test or the paper or the equation change, students are often at a loss for how to adjust.<br><br>This is a course design book centered on the idea that the goal in the college classroom&#x2015;in <i>all</i> classrooms, <i>all</i> the time&#x2015;is to develop students who are not just loaded with content, but capable of using that content in thoughtful, deliberate ways to make the world a better place. Achieving this goal requires a top-to-bottom reconsideration of courses, including student learning goals, text selection and course structure, day-to-day pedagogies, and assignment and project design. <i>Creating Wicked Students</i> takes readers through each step of the process, providing multiple examples at each stage, while always encouraging instructors to consider concepts and exercises in light of their own courses and students.</p><p>Paul Hanstedt is the Director of Pedagogical Innovation at Roanoke College, where, among other things, he has led the revision of a campus-wide general education program, developed an innovative writing-across-the-curriculum program, coordinated the implementation of the college&#x2019;s e-portfolio system, digitized a national literary journal and taught a wide range of courses. He is a faculty member for the AAC&amp;U Institute on General Education and Assessment and the recipient of several teaching awards, including a 2013 State Council for Higher Education in Virginia Outstanding Faculty Award, and the 2014 CASE Carnegie Virginia Professor of the Year. He has received a Fulbright to aid general education curricular revision in Hong Kong, and is co-recipient of a FIPSE grant for sustainable faculty development. He is the author of numerous articles and stories, and two books: <i>Hong Konged</i>, a travel memoir, and <i>General Education Essentials</i>, a faculty introduction to current trends in liberal education."This book could be useful as an introduction to course design for someone less familiar with the fundamentals, such as how to develop measurable learning outcomes, align course goals with institutional goals, nest content within higher-order goals, engage students&#x2019; prior knowledge, or incorporate applied learning. The structure of the book allows for one to follow it step-by-step as a course design manual, and it also includes recursive 'intermissions' to encourage reflection along the way. In addition, his discussion of how to prompt critical thinking through multiple-choice exams offers helpful strategies for encouraging students to explain their thinking on ambiguous questions with follow-up questions that explain or justify their choice." (Reflective Teaching 2018-09-14)<br><br>"<i>Creating Wicked Students</i> is one of the best books I have read in the last decade. I am a mid-career teacher educator and scholar in an English department, and I wish I had read this book when I was a doctoral student. Nevertheless, this outstanding text has a lot to offer for all scholars trying to adapt to changing technologies and learner populations, providing innovative and practical strategies for course design.<p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The main argument of the book centers around the idea that we live in a changing, unpredictable world where the demands and expectations placed on graduates are constantly changing. According to Hanstedt, &#x2018;we need wicked graduates with wicked competencies&#x2019;, which he argues are developed when students are provided with opportunities to apply and use information instead of just receiving it. In a highly accessible and reader-friendly way, Hanstedt explains how this is done. He innovatively illustrates how to build such measurable, clear, and meaningful goals for learning outcomes. &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In conclusion, [this]<i>&nbsp;</i>is a must-read for anyone teaching at the college level. The book provides incredibly useful information not only for current faculty but also for doctoral students who will soon assume faculty positions.

It did not emerge as a modern nation until 1871&#x2014;yet today, Germany is the world&#x2019;s fourth-largest economy and a standard-bearer of liberal democracy.<br><br> &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no point studying the past unless it sheds some light on the present,&#x201d; writes James Hawes in this brilliantly concise history that has already captivated hundreds of thousands of readers. &#x201c;It is time, now more than ever, for us all to understand the real history of Germany.&#x201d;</p><p><b>James Hawes</b> studied German at University of Oxford and University College London, then held lectureships in German at the universities of Maynooth, Sheffield, and Swansea.

It is not accidental that some of the best minds in the Anglosphere have worried away at the German problem ever since 1945. The preceding generation had been dragged into two world wars, the Iron Curtain ran through Berlin, and getting to grips with German history was the key to preventing the Cold War from becoming a Third World War.

When the shooting stops, an officer is dead, Police Chief Jeffrey Tolliver is seriously wounded, and the survivors&#x2014;including a class of grade-school children and medical examiner Sara Linton&#x2014;are held hostage. In a tense standoff that could erupt at any moment into more bloodletting&#x2014;with her ex-husband on the threshold of death&#x2014;Sara must search for answers and an escape in the memories of a time at the start of their relationship when another brutal, shocking crime shattered their small-town world. Because the sins of the past have caught up with Sara and Jeffrey ... with a vengeance.</p></p><p>Medical examiner Sara Linton and police chief Jeffrey Tolliver make their fourth appearance in this riveting new back-and-forth thriller that grounds a brutal attack by two young men on the Grant County, Georgia police department in a twelve-year-old Alabama murder case that occurred while Sara and Jeffrey were just beginning their tumultuous romance. En route to a beach vacation shortly after they meet, the couple takes a detour to the small town where Jeffrey grew up and began his law enforcement career. But their carefree holiday is interrupted when his best friend from childhood, a fellow cop, is charged with murder after killing a man who broke into his house. Despite his subsequent confession, Jeffrey believes there&#x2019;s more to the story than Robert is telling him, and when the skeleton of a young woman with whom both Robert and Tolliver were once involved is discovered in a secret cave only they knew about, and Robert admits to her murder too, Tolliver must again confront a past he thought he had long since put behind him.<p> Slaughter unravels a convoluted story deftly and smoothly as the action moves between those long-ago events and the siege of the police station by two young men who are determined to make Jeffrey pay for a crime they believe he committed. Threatening to kill whoever stands between them and their target--including eight children on a school field trip at the station house when the bloody siege begins--they execute a deputy they mistakenly believe is Tolliver. Skillfully blending past and present events and illuminating the equally convoluted relationship between Sara and Jeffrey (who have married and divorced in the intervening years) without interrupting the breathtaking pace of the action or dropping a beat, Slaughter takes this series to a new level of excellence. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p><p><strong>Karin Slaughter</strong> is one of the world&#x2019;s most popular and acclaimed storytellers.

Ancient and earth-honoring, Voodoo`s practices take on different forms specific to time and place, but its essence remains focused on the loa--the potent spiritual forces of Voodoo that are manifested directly through human beings and their actions. The authors draw strong parallels between the Waite and Thoth Tarots, the Kabalistic Tree of Life, and the Voodoo tradition as it is practiced in New Orleans. Just as the major and minor arcana of the Tarot represent the archetypes of the human psyche and the natural forces of our world, so do the loa of Voodoo embody the primal energies of the universe. With a variety of spreads and readings, the authors show how the Tarot can be an idea channel through which the loa exercise their powers to teach, advise, and initiate the serious student into their mysteries</p><p>Louis Martinie is a teacher and musician, who has served as editor of Black Moon Publishing for the past fifteen years.

Grandfather s rousing tales of a village youth spent tying cobras into knots, shaking mangos for the pickle jar from a giant tree and savoring the 'fluffy-puffy roti that bubbled and wobbled in ghee on the hot, hot tavva pan' inspire young Aneel to give his Dada-ji 'the power of the tiger' once again with a fresh batch of the unleavened treat. Min echoes the narrative s exuberance with bright, blocky acrylic scenes of an Indian family in Western surroundings. After downing the roti with finger-licking enthusiasm, the two proceed outside to shake apples off a tree for Dadi-ma s pie and tie their legs in knots to sit lotus fashion on a grassy hillside.

Zia has an ear for the storyteller s cadence. She creates lyrical lines for the framing narrative and then alters her voice, animating the interior story with exaggeration and exclamations. Min s style is dynamic; he borrows a variety of techniques from graphic novels to delineate time and place and to focus attention. From inset boxes and monochromatic background figures to silhouettes and sequential panels, the effect is exciting and fresh. As Aneel stands on his head in imitation of his grandfather, the room tilts and smoke from the burning incense spreads across the page, carrying light green colored-pencil sketches of the 'wheat fields and swaying coconut palms' of the elders village. This contrasts with the bold colors of the boy s modern living room, rendered in acrylics. Inspired by the story, Aneel starts mixing ingredients. Boy and man chomp and chew.

The couple first met and fell in love in Jim Crow Cedar Point, VA, in 1958, but because Richard was white and Mildred was African American and Cherokee, they were not permitted to marry under Virginia law. The pair did contract nuptials in Washington, DC and eventually had several children, but they weren't content to leave the discriminatory law uncontested. In legal proceedings that led to a Supreme Court case, their union was finally upheld as constitutional. The charming and cheerful mixed media illustrations are done in gouache and acrylic paint with collage and colored pencil, a perfect marriage of Alko and Qualls's art styles. While the text is uninspired in moments, it shines with a message that is universal: "They won the right to their love. They were free at last." Back matter includes an author and artist's note explaining the importance of this topic. A much-needed work on a historical court case that made the ultimate difference on mixed race families that will resonate with contemporary civil rights battles.

The children had been thrust into Doaa's arms by their drowning relatives, all refugees who boarded a dangerously overcrowded ship bound for Sweden and a new life. For days, Doaa floats, prays, and sings to the babies in her arms. She must stay alive for these children. She must not lose hope.</p><p>Doaa Al Zamel was once an average Syrian girl growing up in a crowded house in a bustling city near the Jordanian border. But in 2011, her life was upended. Inspired by the events of the Arab Spring, Syrians began to stand up against their own oppressive regime. When the army was sent to take control of Doaa's hometown, strict curfews, power outages, water shortages, air raids, and violence disrupted everyday life. After Doaa's father's barbershop was destroyed and rumors of women being abducted spread through the community, her family decided to leave Syria for Egypt, where they hoped to stay in peace until they could return home. Only months after their arrival, the Egyptian government was overthrown and the environment turned hostile for refugees.</p><p>In the midst of this chaos, Doaa falls in love with a young opposition fighter who proposes marriage and convinces her to flee to the promise of safety and a better future in Europe. Terrified and unable to swim, Doaa and her young fiance hand their life savings to smugglers and board a dilapidated fishing vessel with five hundred other refugees, including a hundred children. After four horrifying days at sea, another ship, filled with angry men shouting insults, rams into Doaa's boat, sinking it and leaving the passengers to drown.</p><p>That is where Doaa's struggle for survival really begins.</p><p><i>A Hope More Powerful Than the Sea </i>is an emotionally charged, eye-opening true story that represents the millions of unheard voices of refugees who risk everything in a desperate search for the promise of a safe future.

Yet over the last couple of decades, we&#x2019;ve substituted the joy of real friendship with cheap imitations. We settle for &#x201c;community&#x201d; on Facebook and Twitter and a series of text messages that allow us to communicate with someone without the commitment. We like each other&#x2019;s beautifully filtered photos on Instagram and delude ourselves into believing we have a community. But real friendship requires effort. It&#x2019;s showing up, laughing loud, and crying hard. It&#x2019;s forgiving and loving and giving the benefit of the doubt. It&#x2019;s making a casserole, doing a carpool pickup, and making sure she knows those cute shoes are 50 percent off. Written in the same comedic style as the <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers <i>Sparkly Green Earrings</i> and <i>The Antelope in the Living Room</i>, <i>Nobody&#x2019;s Cuter than You</i> is a laugh-out-loud look at the special bond that exists between friends and a poignant celebration of all the extraordinary people God had the good sense to bring into our lives at exactly the right moments. From the friendships we develop over a lifetime to the ones that wounded us and the ones that taught us to love better, Melanie Shankle reveals the influence our friends have on who we were, who we are, and who we will become. And on a day when our jeans feel too tight, our chins have decided to embrace hormone-related acne reminiscent of our teen years, and our kids have tested the limits of our sanity, they are the ones who will look at us and say, &#x201c;Nobody&#x2019;s cuter than you!&#x201d;</p><p>Melanie Shankle writes daily on her blog, Big Mama. She is a graduate of Texas A&amp;M and loves writing, shopping at Target, checking to see what's on sale at Anthropologie, and trying to find the funny in every situation.Most of all, she loves being the mother of Caroline and the wife of her husband, Perry. The three of them live in San Antonio, Texas.</p><h2>MWPFADS - Fresh Approach To The Drum Set</h2><p>A Drummer s Guide to: Rock Beats and Fills Hand &amp; Foot Technique Coordination and Independence Reading Music Understanding Song Construction R&amp;B, Jazz, Latin Styles and more!<br><br>Including: MP3 CD packed with 41 Play-Along Tunes (with and without drums) Featuring World-Renowned Drummer, Stanton Moore!

Then I realized we don&#x2019;t have a vehicle that could even get us as far as Barstow. But then, the next best thing arrived on my desk: Route 66 Adventure Handbook, the updated and expanded edition, by Drew Knowles. Organized in an easy-to-read way, the writing is fun and informative. I had no idea, for instance, that Route 66&#x2015;once the main road going from Chicago to Los Angeles&#x2015;was replaced by five modern highways.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;Contra Costa Times<br><br>&#x201c;The release of the movie Cars has certainly increased interest in Route 66, the classic &#x2018;Mother Road&#x2019; pre-Interstate highway that stretched from Chicago to Los Angeles. Though the road no longer officially exists in the U.S. highway lexicon, many of the tourist sights, motels, and roadside diners along the way have been preserved. Knowles&#x2019;s fifth edition offers insights into offbeat roadside attractions, vintage motels and caf�s, natural wonders, and quirky side trips. The book covers a town-by-town description of Route 66 in Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California, as well as the history of the road and how to find it in places where it might have disappeared. Don&#x2019;t expect to find the Cars town of Radiator Springs, however. It is a fictional amalgamation of many Route 66 places.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;Salt Lake Tribune<br></p><h2>Social Skills Activities for Secondary Students with Special Needs</h2><p><b>A flexible, ready-to-use activities program to help special students in grades 6-12</b> <p>The updated new edition of this valuable resource offers an exciting collection of 200 ready-to-use worksheets to help adolescents build the social skills they need to interact effectively with others and learn how to apply these skills to various real-life settings, situations, and problems.

Beyond all their usual personal and family demands, they must take on the special responsibility of caring for family memers or others with long-term health problems. All the stresses that come with the territory can be overwhelming and make a caregiver feel hopeless at times. With 366 days worth of wisdom and affirmations, Daily Comforts addresses one caregiving issue per day. An index of topics allows caregivers to find the readings most pertinent to their immediate concerns. <p>Written in the first person, each page of Daily Comforts acts as a caregiver's monologue--as if what is on the page is coming directly from his or her mind. Few meditation books offer this approach. The idea is for the reader to transition from "venting" to thinking about the issue from a different perspective, to finding a solution. Daily Comforts works like a support system in a pocket by helping both family and professional caregivers cope with isolation, guilt, exhaustion, and frustration. Each reading concludes with an inspiring, practical affirmation designed to help caregivers better care for themselves.</p>Daily Comforts for Caregivers helps bring peace of mind to those struggling with the responsibilities of caring for someone with chronic or long-term health problems. The 366 daily meditations offer compassionate resassurance and gentle encouragement in simple, down-to-earth language. <p>A poignant and wise book. It captures the experience of caregiving in a way I have not seen in "how to" manuals, and, more importantly, validates caregivers' feelings, giving them the strength to make it through the day. Patricia Schaber, MA, OTR, University of Minnesota </p><p>I highly recommend this book. Anyone who cares for children will find in these pages the strength of their own wisdom and the support of others' experiences.

Today, the same quilts hang on museum walls as modern masterpieces of color and design. Inspired by these quilts and the women who made them, award-winning author Patricia C. McKissack traveled to Alabama to learn their stories. The lyrical rite-of-passage narrative that is the result of her journey seamlessly weaves together the familial, cultural, spiritual, and historical strands of life in this community.</p><p>PATRICIA C. McKISSACK is the author of the Caldecott Honor Book <i>Mirandy and Brother Wind </i>and the Newbery Honor Book <i>The Dark-Thirty</i>. She and her husband, Fred, have written over a hundred books about the African American experience. She has also received the Regina Medal for lifetime achievement in children&#x2019;s books and the Virginia Hamilton Award. To get a feel for the lives of the quilters she describes in this book, Pat traveled to Gee&#x2019;s Bend, Alabama, where she spent several days with the quilt makers and even got a quilting lesson.<br> &nbsp;<br> COZBI A. CABRERA is the illustrator of the picture books <i>Thanks a Million </i>and <i>Beauty, Her Basket</i>. She is also recognized for her handmade textile work, which includes quilts and clothing. Her collectible cloth dolls (<i>mu�ecas</i>) received national attention when they were featured on <i>The Oprah Winfrey Show</i> and <i>The Martha Stewart Show.</i> You can visit her website at cozbi.com.Grade 1&#x2013;5&#x2014;The rural Alabama community of Gee's Bend is widely recognized for its unique quilts. Although the women have been quilting for over a century, their work was unknown until art historian William Arnett discovered it about 20 years ago. <i>Stitchin' and Pullin'</i> is the modern-day story of Baby Girl, who grows from a child playing beneath her elders' quilting frame to becoming a member of the intergenerational circle, piecing together her first quilt. McKissack's free-verse narrative shares the rich heritage of the Gee's Bend artisans as Baby Girl selects the fabrics that have significance to her and her family and finds the "heart" of her quilt. She speaks about the meaning of colors and patterns and what they bring to a quilt. The story is full of love and spirit. Cabrera's acrylic paintings depict the richness of tradition and strength of character as connections are made between fabric and history. Readers will enjoy the slow cadence of verse as they pause to consider history through the eyes of the people who lived it and the legacy that is passed on to the next generation.&#x2014;<i>Lisa Glasscock, Columbine Public Library, Littleton, CO</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

To his surprise, New Skete monks have most of their hair. They're Russian Orthodox, not Buddhist, and they're also world-renowned German shepherd breeders and authors of dog-training books that have sold in the millions.<br> As Jesse struggles to fit in amongst the odd but lovable monks, self-doubt begins to beat like a tribal drum. Questioning his motivation to embark on this adventure and missing his family (and phone), Jesse struggles to balance his desire for inner peace with his need to check Twitter. But in the end, Jesse discovers the undeniable power of the monks and their wisdom, and the very real benefits of taking a well-deserved break as a means of self-preservation in our fast-paced world.</p><p><b>Jesse Itzler</b> only eats fruit 'til noon, loves Run-D.M.C., and enjoys living life "out of the box."

The author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller, <i>Living with a SEAL</i>, cofounded Marquis Jet, the world's largest private jet card company which he and his partner sold to Berkshire Hathaway/NetJets. Jesse then partnered with Zico coconut water, which he and his partner sold to The Coca-Cola Company. He's a former rapper on MTV and wrote and performed the NBA's Emmy Award-winning "I Love This Game" music campaign and the popular New York Knicks anthem "Go NY Go." When he's not running ultra-marathons, eating vegan food or being a dad to his four kids, Jesse can be found at the NBA's Atlanta Hawks games, where he's an owner of the team. He is married to Spanx founder Sara Blakely."At a time when stress and burnout have become global epidemics, along comes Jesse Itzler to remind us how important it is to be present, intentional and connect with ourselves and with what really matters.

Fue una Hispano-Olivetti, y de ella me separ� durante semanas el cristal de un escaparate. Visto desde hoy, desde el parapeto de los a�os transcurridos, cuesta creer que un simple objeto mec�nico pudiera tener el potencial suficiente como para quebrar el rumbo de una vida y dinamitar en cuatro d�as todos los planes trazados para sostenerla. As� fue, sin embargo, y nada pude hacer para impedirlo.<br> <br>No eran en realidad grandes proyectos los que yo atesoraba por entonces. Se trataba tan s�lo de aspiraciones cercanas, casi dom�sticas, coherentes con las coordenadas del sitio y el tiempo que me correspondi� vivir; planes de futuro asequibles a poco que estirara las puntas de los dedos. En aquellos d�as mi mundo giraba lentamente alrededor de unas cuantas presencias que yo cre�a firmes e imperecederas. Mi madre hab�a configurado siempre la m�s s�lida de todas ellas. Era modista, trabajaba como oficiala en un taller de noble clientela. Ten�a experiencia y buen criterio, pero nunca fue m�s que una simple costurera asalariada; una trabajadora como tantas otras que, durante diez horas diarias, se dejaba las u�as y las pupilas cortando y cosiendo, probando y rectificando prendas destinadas a cuerpos que no eran el suyo y a miradas que raramente tendr�an por destino a su persona. De mi padre sab�a poco entonces. Nada, apenas. Nunca lo tuve cerca; tampoco me afect� su ausencia. Jam�s sent� excesiva curiosidad por saber de �l hasta que mi madre, a mis ocho o nueve a�os, se aventur� a proporcionarme algunas migas de informaci�n. Que �l ten�a otra familia, que era imposible que viviera con nosotras. Engull� aquellos datos con la misma prisa y escasa apetencia con las que remat� las �ltimas cucharadas del potaje de Cuaresma que ten�a frente a m�: la vida de aquel ser ajeno me interesaba bastante menos que bajar con premura a jugar a la plaza.<br> <br>Hab�a nacido en el verano de 1911, el mismo a�o en el que Pastora Imperio se cas� con el Gallo, vio la luz en M�xico Jorge Negrete, y en Europa deca�a la estrella de un tiempo al que llamaron la <i>Belle �poque</i>. A lo lejos comenzaban a o�rse los tambores de lo que ser�a la primera gran guerra y en los caf�s de Madrid se le�a por entonces <i>El Debate</i> y <i>El Heraldo</i> mientras la Chelito, desde los escenarios, enfebrec�a a los hombres moviendo con descaro las caderas a ritmo de cupl�. El rey Alfonso XIII, entre amante y amante, logr� arregl�rselas para engendrar en aquellos meses a su quinta hija leg�tima. Al mando de su gobierno estaba entretanto el liberal Canalejas, incapaz de presagiar que tan s�lo un a�o m�s tarde un exc�ntrico anarquista iba a acabar con su vida descerraj�ndole dos tiros en la cabeza mientras observaba las novedades de la librer�a San Mart�n.<br> <br>Crec� en un entorno moderadamente feliz, con m�s apreturas que excesos pero sin grandes carencias ni frustraciones. Me cri� en una calle estrecha de un barrio castizo de Madrid, junto a la plaza de la Paja, a dos pasos del Palacio Real. A tiro de piedra del bullicio imparable del coraz�n de la ciudad, en un ambiente de ropa tendida, olor a lej�a, voces de vecinas y gatos al sol. Asist� a una rudimentaria escuela en una entreplanta cercana: en sus bancos, previstos para dos cuerpos, nos acomod�bamos de cuatro en cuatro los chavales, sin concierto y a empujones para recitar a voz en grito <i>La canci�n del pirata</i> y las tablas de multiplicar. Aprend� all� a leer y escribir, a manejar las cuatro reglas y el nombre de los r�os que surcaban el mapa amarillento colgado de la pared. A los doce a�os acab� mi formaci�n y me incorpor� en calidad de aprendiza al taller en el que trabajaba mi madre. Mi suerte natural.<br> <br>Del negocio de do�a Manuela Godina, su due�a, llevaban d�cadas saliendo prendas primorosas, excelentemente cortadas y cosidas, reputadas en todo Madrid. Trajes de d�a, vestidos de c�ctel, abrigos y capas que despu�s ser�an lucidos por se�oras distinguidas en sus paseos por la Castellana, en el Hip�dromo y el polo de Puerta de Hierro, al tomar t� en Sakuska y cuando acud�an a las iglesias de relumbr�n. Transcurri� alg�n tiempo, sin embargo, hasta que comenc� a adentrarme en los secretos de la costura. Antes fui la chica para todo del taller: la que remov�a el pic�n de los braseros y barr�a del suelo los recortes, la que calentaba las planchas en la lumbre y corr�a sin resuello a comprar hilos y botones a la plaza de Pontejos. La encargada de hacer llegar a las selectas residencias los modelos reci�n terminados envueltos en grandes sacos de lienzo moreno: mi tarea favorita, el mejor entretenimiento en aquella carrera incipiente. Conoc� as� a los porteros y ch�feres de las mejores fincas, a las doncellas, amas y mayordomos de las familias m�s adineradas. Contempl� sin apenas ser vista a las se�oras m�s refinadas, a sus hijas y maridos. Y como un testigo mudo, me adentr� en sus casas burguesas, en palacetes aristocr�ticos y en los pisos suntuosos de los edificios con solera. En algunas ocasiones no llegaba a traspasar las zonas de servicio y alguien del cuerpo de casa se ocupaba de recibir el traje que yo portaba; en otras, sin embargo, me animaban a adentrarme hasta los vestidores y para ello recorr�a los pasillos y atisbaba los salones, y me com�a con los ojos las alfombras, las l�mparas de ara�a, las cortinas de terciopelo y los pianos de cola que a veces alguien tocaba y a veces no, pensando en lo extra�a que ser�a la vida en un universo como aqu�l.<br> <br>Mis d�as transcurr�an sin tensi�n en esos dos mundos, casi ajena a la incongruencia que entre ambos exist�a. Con la misma naturalidad transitaba por aquellas anchas v�as jalonadas de pasos de carruajes y grandes portalones que recorr�a el entramado enloquecido de las calles tortuosas de mi barrio, repletas siempre de charcos, desperdicios, griter�o de vendedores y ladridos punzantes de perros con hambre; aquellas calles por las que los cuerpos siempre andaban con prisa y en las que, a la voz de agua va, m�s val�a ponerse a cobijo para evitar llenarse de salpicaduras de or�n. Artesanos, peque�os comerciantes, empleados y jornaleros reci�n llegados a la capital llenaban las casas de alquiler y dotaban a mi barrio de su alma de pueblo. Muchos de ellos apenas traspasaban sus confines a no ser por causa de fuerza mayor; mi madre y yo, en cambio, lo hac�amos temprano cada ma�ana, juntas y apresuradas, para trasladarnos a la calle Zurbano y acoplarnos sin demora a nuestro cotidiano quehacer en el taller de do�a Manuela.<br> <br>Al cumplirse un par de a�os de mi entrada en el negocio, decidieron entre ambas que hab�a llegado el momento de que aprendiera a coser. A los catorce comenc� con lo m�s simple: presillas, sobrehilados, hilvanes flojos. Despu�s vinieron los ojales, los pespuntes y dobladillos. Trabaj�bamos sentadas en peque�as sillas de enea, encorvadas sobre tablones de madera sostenidos encima de las rodillas; en ellos apoy�bamos nuestro quehacer. Do�a Manuela trataba con las clientas, cortaba, probaba y correg�a. Mi madre tomaba las medidas y se encargaba del resto: cos�a lo m�s delicado y distribu�a las dem�s tareas, supervisaba su ejecuci�n e impon�a el ritmo y la disciplina a un peque�o batall�n formado por media docena de modistas maduras, cuatro o cinco mujeres j�venes y unas cuantas aprendizas parlanchinas, siempre con m�s ganas de risa y chisme que de puro faenar. Algunas cuajaron como buenas costureras, otras no fueron capaces y quedaron para siempre encargadas de las funciones menos agradecidas. Cuando una se iba, otra nueva la sustitu�a en aquella estancia embarullada, incongruente con la serena opulencia de la fachada y la sobriedad del sal�n luminoso al que s�lo ten�an acceso las clientas. Ellas, do�a Manuela y mi madre, eran las �nicas que pod�an disfrutar de sus paredes enteladas color azafr�n; las �nicas que pod�an acercarse a los muebles de caoba y pisar el suelo de roble que las m�s j�venes nos encarg�bamos de abrillantar con trapos de algod�n. S�lo ellas recib�an de tanto en tanto los rayos de sol que entraban a trav�s de los cuatro altos balcones volcados a la calle. El resto de la tropa permanec�amos siempre en la retaguardia: en aquel gineceo helador en invierno e infernal en verano que era nuestro taller, ese espacio trasero y gris que se abr�a con apenas dos ventanucos a un oscuro patio interior, y en el que las horas transcurr�an como soplos de aire entre tarareo de coplas y el ruido de tijeras.<br> <br>Aprend� r�pido. Ten�a dedos �giles que pronto se adaptaron al contorno de las agujas y al tacto de los tejidos. A las medidas, las piezas y los vol�menes. Talle delantero, contorno de pecho, largo de pierna. Sisa, bocamanga, bies. A los diecis�is aprend� a distinguir las telas, a los diecisiete, a apreciar sus calidades y calibrar su potencial. Cresp�n de China, muselina de seda, georgette, chantilly. Pasaban los meses como en una noria: los oto�os haciendo abrigos de buenos pa�os y trajes de entretiempo, las primaveras cosiendo vestidos vol�tiles destinados a las vacaciones cant�bricas, largas y ajenas, de La Concha y El Sardinero. Cumpl� los dieciocho, los diecinueve. Me inici� poco a poco en el manejo del corte y en la confecci�n de las partes m�s delicadas. Aprend� a montar cuellos y solapas, a prever ca�das y anticipar acabados. Me gustaba mi trabajo, disfrutaba con �l. Do�a Manuela y mi madre me ped�an a veces opini�n, empezaban a confiar en m�. �La ni�a tiene mano y ojo, Dolores &#x2014;dec�a do�a Manuela&#x2014;. Es buena, y mejor que va a ser si no se nos desv�a. Mejor que t�, como te descuides.� Y mi madre segu�a a lo suyo, como si no la oyera. Yo tampoco levantaba la cabeza de mi tabla, fing�a no haber escuchado nada. Pero con disimulo la miraba de reojo y ve�a que en su boca cuajada de alfileres se apuntaba una lev�sima sonrisa.<br> <br>Pasaban los a�os, pasaba la vida. Cambiaba tambi�n la moda y a su dictado se acomodaba el quehacer del taller. Despu�s de la guerra europea hab�an llegado las l�neas rectas, se arrumbaron los cors�s y las piernas comenzaron a ense�arse sin pizca de rubor. Sin embargo, cuando los felices veinte alcanzaron su fin, las cinturas de los vestidos regresaron a su sitio natural, las faldas se alargaron y el recato volvi� a imponerse en mangas, escotes y voluntad. Saltamos entonces a una nueva d�cada y llegaron m�s cambios. Todos juntos, imprevistos, casi al mont�n. Cumpl� los veinte, vino la Rep�blica y conoc� a Ignacio. Un domingo de septiembre en la Bombilla; en un baile bullanguero abarrotado de muchachas de talleres, malos estudiantes y soldados de permiso. Me sac� a bailar, me hizo re�r. Dos semanas despu�s empezamos a trazar planes para casarnos.<br> <br>�Qui�n era Ignacio, qu� supuso para m�? El hombre de mi vida, pens� entonces. El muchacho tranquilo que intu� destinado a ser el buen padre de mis hijos. Hab�a ya alcanzado la edad en la que, para las muchachas como yo, sin apenas oficio ni beneficio, no quedaban demasiadas opciones m�s all� del matrimonio. El ejemplo de mi madre, cri�ndome sola y trabajando para ello de sol a sol, jam�s se me hab�a antojado un destino apetecible. Y en Ignacio encontr� a un candidato id�neo para no seguir sus pasos: alguien con quien recorrer el resto de mi vida adulta sin tener que despertar cada ma�ana con la boca llena de sabor a soledad. No me llev� a �l una pasi�n turbadora, pero s� un afecto intenso y la certeza de que mis d�as, a su lado, transcurrir�an sin pesares ni estridencias, con la dulce suavidad de una almohada.<br> <br>Ignacio Montes, cre�, iba a ser el due�o del brazo al que me agarrar�a en uno y mil paseos, la presencia cercana que me proporcionar�a seguridad y cobijo para siempre. Dos a�os mayor que yo, flaco, afable, tan f�cil como tierno. Ten�a buena estatura y pocas carnes, maneras educadas y un coraz�n en el que la capacidad para quererme parec�a multiplicarse con las horas. Hijo de viuda castellana con los duros bien contados debajo del colch�n; residente con intermitencias en pensiones de poca monta; aspirante ilusionado a profesional de la burocracia y eterno candidato a todo ministerio capaz de prometerle un sueldo de por vida. Guerra, Gobernaci�n, Hacienda. El sue�o de tres mil pesetas al a�o, doscientas cuarenta y una al mes: un salario fijo para siempre jam�s a cambio de dedicar el resto de sus d�as al mundo manso de los negociados y antedespachos, de los secantes, el papel de barba, los timbres y los tinteros. Sobre ello planificamos nuestro futuro: a lomos de la calma chicha de un funcionariado que, convocatoria a convocatoria, se negaba con cabezoner�a a incorporar a mi Ignacio en su n�mina. Y �l insist�a sin desaliento. Y en febrero probaba con Justicia y en junio con Agricultura, y vuelta a empezar.<br> <br>Y entretanto, incapaz de permitirse distracciones costosas pero dispuesto hasta la muerte a hacerme feliz, Ignacio me agasajaba con las humildes posibilidades que su paup�rrimo bolsillo le permit�a: una caja de cart�n llena de gusanos de seda y hojas de morera, cucuruchos de casta�as asadas y promesas de amor eterno sobre la hierba bajo el viaducto. Juntos escuch�bamos a la banda de m�sica del quiosco del parque del Oeste y rem�bamos en las barcas del Retiro en las ma�anas de domingo que hac�a sol. No hab�a verbena con columpios y organillo a la que no acudi�ramos, ni chotis que no bail�ramos con precisi�n de reloj. Cu�ntas tardes pasamos en las Vistillas, cu�ntas pel�culas vimos en cines de barrio de a una cincuenta. Una horchata valenciana era para nosotros un lujo y un taxi, un espejismo. La ternura de Ignacio, por no ser gravosa, carec�a sin embargo de fin. Yo era su cielo y las estrellas, la m�s guapa, la mejor. Mi pelo, mi cara, mis ojos. Mis manos, mi boca, mi voz.

La Segunda Rep�blica hab�a infundido un soplo de agitaci�n sobre la confortable prosperidad del entorno de nuestras clientas. Madrid andaba convulso y fren�tico, la tensi�n pol�tica impregnaba todas las esquinas. Las buenas familias prolongaban hasta el infinito sus veraneos en el norte, deseosas de permanecer al margen de la capital inquieta y rebelde en cuyas plazas se anunciaba a voces el <i>Mundo Obrero</i> mientras los proletarios descamisados del extrarradio se adentraban sin retraimiento hasta la misma Puerta del Sol. Los grandes coches privados empezaban a escasear por las calles, las fiestas opulentas menudeaban. Las viejas damas enlutadas rezaban novenas para que Aza�a cayera pronto y el ruido de las balas se hac�a cotidiano a la hora en que encend�an las farolas de gas. Los anarquistas quemaban iglesias, los falangistas desenfundaban pistolas con porte bravuc�n. Con frecuencia creciente, los arist�cratas y altos burgueses cubr�an con s�banas los muebles, desped�an al servicio, apestillaban las contraventanas y part�an con urgencia hacia el extranjero, sacando a mansalva joyas, miedos y billetes por las fronteras, a�orando al rey exiliado y una Espa�a obediente que a�n tardar�a en llegar.<br> <br>Y en el taller de do�a Manuela cada vez entraban menos se�oras, sal�an menos pedidos y hab�a menos quehacer.

In <i>Lost Plantations of the South</i>, Marc R. Matrana weaves together photographs, diaries and letters, architectural renderings, and other rare documents to tell the story of sixty of these vanquished estates and the people who once called them home.</p><p>From plantations that were destroyed by natural disaster such as Alabama's Forks of Cypress, to those that were intentionally demolished such as Seven Oaks in Louisiana and Mount Brilliant in Kentucky, Matrana resurrects these lost mansions. Including plantations throughout the South as well as border states, Matrana carefully tracks the histories of each from the earliest days of construction to the often contentious struggles to preserve these irreplaceable historic treasures. <i>Lost Plantations of the South</i> explores the root causes of demise and provides understanding and insight on how lessons learned in these sad losses can help prevent future preservation crises. Capturing the voices of masters and mistresses alongside those of slaves, and featuring more than one hundred elegant archival illustrations, this book explores the powerful and complex histories of these cardinal homes across the South.</p></p><p><p>An illustrated history of the grand southern plantation homes lost to war, disaster, neglect, and progress</p><p>Born in New Orleans, Louisiana, Marc R.

Updated with photos and with an insightful introduction and a revised discography, both written by celebrated music writer David Ritz.<br><i><br>Lady Sings the Blues</i> is the fiercely honest, no-holds-barred autobiography of Billie Holiday, the legendary jazz, swing, and standards singing sensation. Taking the reader on a fast-moving journey from Holiday&#x2019;s rough-and-tumble Baltimore childhood (where she ran errands at a whorehouse in exchange for the chance to listen to Louis Armstrong and Bessie Smith albums), to her emergence on Harlem&#x2019;s club scene, to sold-out performances with the Count Basie Orchestra and with Artie Shaw and his band, this revelatory memoir is notable for its trenchant observations on the racism that darkened Billie&#x2019; s life and the heroin addiction that ended it too soon. We are with her during the mesmerizing debut of &#x201c;Strange Fruit&#x201d;; with her as she rubs shoulders with the biggest movie stars and musicians of the day (Bob Hope, Lana Turner, Clark Gable, Benny Goodman, Lester Young, Coleman Hawkins, and more); and with her through the scrapes with Jim Crow, spats with Sarah Vaughan, ignominious jailings, and tragic decline. All of this is told in Holiday&#x2019;s tart, streetwise style and hip patois that makes it read as if it were written yesterday.</p><p><p>Eleanora Fagan, who later took the name BILLIE HOLIDAY, was born April 7, 1915, and died when she was just forty-four, on July 17, 1959. Coauthor WILLIAM DUFTY (1916&#x2013;2002) was a music enthusiast, freelance writer for the<i> New York Post</i>, and Gloria Swanson&#x2019;s last husband.</p>Chapter 1<br>Some Other Spring<br>Mom and Pop were just a couple of kids when they got married. He was eighteen, she was sixteen, and I was three.<br><br>Mom was working as a maid with a white family. When they found out she was going to have a baby they just threw her out. Pop's family just about had a fit, too, when they heard about it. They were real society folks and they never heard of things like that going on in their part of East Baltimore.<br><br>But both kids were poor. And when you're poor, you grow up fast.<br><br>It's a wonder my mother didn't end up in the workhouse and me as a foundling. But Sadie Fagan loved me from the time I was just a swift kick in the ribs while she scrubbed floors. She went to the hospital and made a deal with the head woman there. She told them she'd scrub floors and wait on the other bitches laying up there to have their kids so she could pay her way and mine. And she did. Mom was thirteen that Wednesday, April 7, 1915, in Baltimore when I was born.<br><br>By the time she worked her way out of hock in the hospital and took me home to her folks, I was so big and smart I could sit up in a carriage. Pop was doing what all the boys did then--peddling papers, running errands, going to school. One day he came along by my carriage, picked me up and started playing with me. His mother saw him and came hollering. She dragged at him and said, "Clarence, stop playing with that baby. Everybody is going to think it's yours."<br><br>"But, Mother, it <i>is</i> mine," he'd tell her. When he talked back to his mother like this she would really have a fit. He was still only fifteen and in short pants. He wanted to be a musician and used to take lessons on the trumpet. It was almost three years before he got long pants for the wedding.<br><br>After they were married awhile we moved into a little old house on Durham Street in Baltimore. Mom had worked as a maid up North in New York and Philly. She'd seen all the rich people with their gas and electric lights and she decided she had to have them too. So she saved her wages for the day. And when we moved in we were the first family in the neighborhood to have gas and electricity.<br><br>It made the neighbors mad, Mom putting in the gas. They said putting pipes in the ground would bring the rats out. It was true. Baltimore is famous for rats.<br><br>Pop always wanted to blow the trumpet but he never got the chance. Before we got one to blow, the Army grabbed him and shipped him overseas. It was just his luck to be one of the ones to get it from poison gas over there. It ruined his lungs. I suppose if he'd played piano he'd probably have got shot in the hand.<br><br>Getting gassed was the end of his hopes for the trumpet but the beginning of a successful career on the guitar. He started to learn it when he was in Paris. And it was a good thing he did. Because it kept him from going to pieces when he got back to Baltimore. He just <i>had</i> to be a musician. He worked like hell when he got back and eventually got a job with McKinney's Cotton Pickers. But when he went on the road with that band it was the beginning of the end of our life as a family. Baltimore got to be just another one-night stand.<br><br>While Pop was overseas in the war, Mom had worked in a factory making Army overalls and uniforms. When Pop hit the road, the war jobs were finished and Mom figured she could do better going off up North as a maid. She had to leave me with my grandparents, who lived in a poor little old house with my cousin Ida, her two small children, Henry and Elsie, and my great-grandmother.<br><br>All of us were crowded in that little house like fishes. I had to sleep in the same bed with Henry and Elsie, and Henry used to wet it every night. It made me mad and sometimes I'd get up and sit in a chair until morning. Then my cousin Ida would come in in the morning, see the bed, accuse me of wetting it, and start beating me. When she was upset she'd beat me something awful. Not with a strap, not with a spank on the ass, but with her fists or a whip.<br><br>She just didn't understand me. Other kids, when they did something wrong, would lie their way out of it. But if I did anything wrong I'd come right out and admit it. And she'd have a fit, call me a sinner and tell me I'd never amount to anything. She never got through telling my mother I was going to bring home a baby and disgrace the damn family like she did. One time she heard me say "Damn it" and she thought this was so sinful she tossed a pot of hot starch at me. She missed, though, because I ducked.<br><br>She was always finding fault with whatever I did, but she never did pick up on Henry. He was her son and he could do no wrong. When I got tired of getting beaten because he wet the bed I got Elsie one night and convinced her we should both sleep on the floor. She was scared. It was cold and she thought we might freeze.<br><br>"All right," I told her, "so we might freeze. But if we ain't frozen to death in the morning, the bed'll be wet and we won't be in it."<br><br>It was and we weren't, so this time Cousin Ida beat me for being smart with her. "Henry's weak," she said.<br><br>You couldn't tell her nothing about Henry, why that boy used to give us girls a terrible time. He even tried to do what we called "that thing" to us while we were sleeping. Sometimes we would be so tired from fighting this little angel off all night, we wouldn't wake up in time for school. I used to try to plead with him because I knew it wouldn't do any good to talk to Cousin Ida.<br><br>"Henry," I'd say to him, "it ain't so bad with me. I'm only your cousin. But Elsie's your sister, and besides, she's sick."<br><br>Henry grew up to be a prize fighter and then a minister. But when he was little I had hell with that boy.<br><br>One day we were playing baseball and afterwards I was sitting on the curb. I was scared of the tiniest bugs, anything that crawled, and Henry knew it. This day he came up to me holding one of Baltimore's biggest goddamn rats by the tail, swinging it in my face.<br><br>"Don't do that, Henry," I begged him.<br><br>"What's the matter, you scared?" he said, grinning and swinging it closer and closer to me.<br><br>"All girls is scared of rats and bugs," I said.<br><br>He kept right on swinging. Finally he hit me in the face with the rat. I took a baseball bat and put him in the Johns Hopkins Hospital.<br><br>I don't think my grandma ever understood me either, but she never beat me like Cousin Ida did, and that was something. My grandpop loved me, though. He was half Irish and named after his father, Charles Fagan, who was straight from Ireland.<br><br>The one I really liked best, though, was my great-grandmother, my grandfather's mother.<br><br>She really loved me and I was crazy about her. She had been a slave on a big plantation in Virginia and she used to tell me about it. She had her own little house in the back of the plantation. Mr. Charles Fagan, the handsome Irish plantation owner, had his white wife and children in the big house. And he had my great-grandmother out in back. She had sixteen children by him, and all of them were dead by then except Grandpop.<br><br>We used to talk about life. And she used to tell me how it felt to be a slave, to be owned body and soul by a white man who was the father of her children. She couldn't read or write, but she knew the Bible by heart from beginning to end and she was always ready to tell me a story from the Scriptures.<br><br>She was ninety-six or ninety-seven then and had dropsy. I used to take care of her every day after school. No one else paid any attention. I'd give her a bath sometimes. And I'd always bind her legs with fresh cloths and wash the smelly old ones.<br><br>She'd been sleeping in chairs for ten years. The doctor had told her she'd die if ever she laid down. But I didn't know. And once after I'd changed the cloths on her legs and she had told me a story, she begged me to let her lie down. She said she was tired. I didn't want to let her. But she kept begging and begging. It was pitiful.<br><br>Finally I spread a blanket on the floor and helped her stretch out. Then she asked me to lie down with her because she wanted to tell me another story. I was tired too. I'd been up early that morning to scrub steps. So I laid down with her. I don't remember the story she told me because I fell asleep right away.<br><br>I woke up four or five hours later. Grandma's arm was still tight around my neck and I couldn't move it. I tried and tried and then I got scared. She was dead, and I began to scream. The neighbors came running. They had to break Grandma's arm to get me loose. Then they took me to a hospital. I was there for a month. Suffering from what they said was shock.<br><br>When I got home Cousin Ida started right in where she had left off, beating me. This time it was for letting Grandma out of her chair. The doctor tried to stop her. He said if she kept it up I'd grow up to be nervous. But she never stopped.<br>I was a woman when I was sixteen. I was big for my age, with big breasts, big bones, a big fat healthy broad, that's all. So I started working out then, before school and after, minding babies, running errands, and scrubbing those damn white steps all over Baltimore.<br><br>When families in the neighborhood used to pay me a nickel for scrubbing them down, I decided I had to have more money, so I figured out a way. I bought me a brush of my own, a bucket, some rags, some Octagon soap, and a big white bar of that stuff I can't ever forget--Bon Ami.<br><br>The first time I stood on a white doorstep and asked this woman for fifteen cents for the job, she like to had a fit. But I explained to her the higher price came from me bringing my own supplies. She thought I had a damn nerve, I guess, but while she was thinking it over I said I'd scrub the kitchen or bathroom floor for the same price. That did it. I had the job.<br><br>All these bitches were lazy. I knew it and that's where I had them. They didn't care how filthy their damn houses were inside, as long as those white steps were clean. Sometimes I'd bring home as much as ninety cents a day. I even made as high as $2.10--that's fourteen kitchen or bathroom floors and as many sets of steps.<br><br>When I went into the scrubbing business it was the end of roller skating, bike riding, and boxing, too. I used to like boxing. In school they used to teach us girls to box. But I didn't keep it up. Once a girl hit me on the nose and it just about finished me. I took my gloves off and beat the pants off her. The gym teacher got so sore, I never went near the school gym again.<br><br>But whether I was riding a bike or scrubbing somebody's dirty bathroom floor, I used to love to sing all the time. I liked music. If there was a place where I could go and hear it, I went.<br><br>Alice Dean used to keep a whorehouse on the corner nearest our place, and I used to run errands for her and the girls. I was very commercial in those days. I'd never go to the store for anybody for less than a nickel or a dime. But I'd run all over for Alice and the girls, and I'd wash basins, put out the Lifebuoy soap and towels. When it came time to pay me, I used to tell her she could keep the money if she'd let me come up in her front parlor and listen to Louis Armstrong and Bessie Smith on her victrola.<br><br>A victrola was a big deal in those days, and there weren't any parlors around that had one except Alice's. I spent many a wonderful hour there listening to Pops and Bessie. I remember Pops' recording of "West End Blues" and how it used to gas me. It was the first time I ever heard anybody sing without using any words. I didn't know he was singing whatever came into his head when he forgot the lyrics. Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba and the rest of it had plenty of meaning for me--just as much meaning as some of the other words that I didn't always understand. But the meaning used to change, depending on how I felt. Sometimes the record would make me so sad I'd cry up a storm. Other times the same damn record would make me so happy I'd forget about how much hard-earned money the session in the parlor was costing me.<br><br>But Mom didn't favor her daughter hanging around the house on the corner. And especially she couldn't understand why I wasn't bringing home any loot. "I know Eleanora," she used to complain, Eleanora being the name I'd been baptized under, "and she don't work for nobody for nothing." When Mom found out I was using my hard-earned money paying rent on Alice's parlor to listen to jazz on the victrola, she nearly had a fit too.<br><br>I guess I'm not the only one who heard their first good jazz in a whorehouse. But I never tried to make anything of it. If I'd heard Louis and Bessie at a Girl Scout jamboree, I'd have loved it just the same. But a lot of white people first heard jazz in places like Alice Dean's, and they helped label jazz "whorehouse music."</p><h2>At Bertram&#39;s Hotel: A Miss Marple Mystery (Miss Marple Mysteries, 10)</h2><p><p> An old-fashioned London hotel is not quite as reputable as it makes out to be.�</p> <p> When Miss Marple comes up from the country for a holiday in London, she finds what she�s looking for at Bertram�s Hotel: traditional decor, impeccable service, and an unmistakable atmosphere of danger behind the highly polished veneer. Yet, not even Miss Marple can foresee the violent chain of events set in motion when an eccentric guest makes his way to the airport on the wrong day.�</p></p><p><p>Agatha Christie is the most widely published author of all time, outsold only by the Bible and Shakespeare. Her books have sold more than a billion copies in English and another billion in a hundred foreign languages. She died in 1976.</p>Miss Jane Marple's holiday in London at the well-run, traditional Bertram's Hotel turns out to be more than she bargained for as her suspicions are aroused by some of the guests. Her worst fears are confirmed when the doorman is murdered in strange circumstances. With the help of clever Chief Inspector Davey, who is occupied with the investigation of a series of robberies, the complicated plot is satisfactorily concluded. Rosemary Leach so skillfully chooses voices for the characters that there is no doubt that this is exactly what the author intended each to sound like. With perfect pacing and exquisite timing, the story is seamlessly told. The delivery is so successful that one actually forgets that only one person is reading; the performance sounds as if it is being delivered by an entire cast of actors. S.S.R.

Secretly she is afraid that if she can&#39;t do something well, or be the best, she will feel like a failure. She is scared that she is not good enough. Gradually, through the help of her teachers and mother, Sally learns to have fun and not worry so much about being the best.</p><p>In addition to being a school psychologist, Ellen Flanagan Burns is a licensed massage therapist. She is a strong supporter of cognitive-based interventions and believes that bibliotherapy with children is extremely powerful. She has a particular interest in helping children with anxiety-related issues because she has worked with many children suffering from them and has dealt with perfectionism personally and professionally. She lives in Newark, Delaware with her family. Erica Pelton Villnave&#39;s involvement in children&#39;s literature began at The Maryland Institute College of Art where she studied illustration.Grade 3&#x2013;5&#x2014;Sally Sanders exhibits many of the classic symptoms of a perfectionist: she feels embarrassed when she makes minor mistakes, she procrastinates, she has a domineering attitude, and so on. This chapter book follows her from music recital to gym class and school play. Adults around Sally are saccharine and unrealistic, constantly building her up and reassuring her that mistakes are a part of everyday life-to the point of tedium. The story lacks cohesion and reads like a string of examples of perfectionist behavior. The language is dull, the message is heavy-handed, the time line is inconsistent, and the characters are underdeveloped. An introductory note outlines the story and aims to help the perfectionist child. Chapters begin with a full-page illustration, and smaller pictures are interspersed throughout. The bright cartoon watercolors will appeal to younger readers, but as a whole the book's audience is limited.&#x2014;<i>Laura Butler, Mount Laurel Library, NJ</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Newspaper reporter Buck Williams and his wife, Chloe, question whether or not they should have a child when the future of the world is so uncertain. Meanwhile, Rayford Steele discovers the shocking truth about his wife, Amanda. <br>Nicolae Carpathia continues his rise to power, forcing believers underground. But Nicolae isn't prepared for a plague of scorpion-like locusts tormenting his followers&#x2015;with a pain so horrible that men try to kill themselves but aren't allowed to die. <br>A repackage of the fifth book in the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling Left Behind series.</p><p><i>Apollyon: The Destroyer Is Unleashed</i>, by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins, is another suspenseful chronicle of those left behind after the rapture of the saved. As the book opens, Hattie Durham, the former airline attendant and mistress of the antichrist, Nicolae Carpathia, is wracked with confusion about what to do with her illegitimate child, whose birth date is coming due. Rayford Steele, the airline pilot who flies Carpathia's plane, is ambivalent about the mounting evidence that his late wife, Amanda, may have been a false believer. Buck, the ace newspaper reporter, and Chloe, his wife, are debating whether to have a child when the future of the world is so uncertain. And all of the world's thousands of believers are gathering in Jerusalem for a stadium rally, which will lead to a showdown with Nicolae Carpathia. Believers are increasingly relying on the Internet for underground communication, and most of them are becoming more and more tempted by violence as a way of battling the forces of evil overtaking the world. But demon locusts are shortly dispatched as a divine plague to attack those who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads; this buys the believers a little bit of time to solve their respective personal crises, all of which end in ways that will keep you riveted until the last page.The world holds its breath as the Tribulation Force ventures to Jerusalem for the great Meeting of the Witnesses. Tens of thousands of the 144,000 witnesses prophesied in Scripture meet at Teddy Kollek Stadium to sit under the teaching of their pastor-teacher, Tsion Ben-Judah.<p>Rayford Steele and Buck Williams, charter members of the Force, have gone from employees of Nicolae Carpathia to international fugitives. Rayford, finally discovering the shocking truth about Amanda, must flee before the grand conference begins. The two witnesses at the Wailing Wall proclaim warnings to the "one who sits on the throne of the earth", and Carpathia himself makes a surprise appearance at the stadium.</p><p>The Tribulation calendar moves ever closer to the halfway point, which the two witnesses call "the due time". Meanwhile, the fourth Trumpet Judgment strikes the solar system, crippling life on earth.</p><p>The next three judgments are to be so much worse than anything that has come before that an angel flies about heaven, warning the earth of the three woes. The fifth Trumpet Judgment -- a plague of scorpionlike locusts led by Apollyon, chief demon of the abyss -- is so horrifying that men try to kill themselves but are not allowed to die.</p></p><h2>Italian Verb Drills, Fourth Edition</h2><p><p><b>Publisher's Note: Products purchased from Third Party sellers are not guaranteed by the publisher for quality, authenticity, or access to any online entitlements included with the product.</b></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Get on the Fast Track to Mastering the Italian Verb System!</strong></p><p>Confident use of verbs is an essential foundation for learning Italian. <em>Italian Verb Drills</em> will help you lay this foundation through clear explanations and rigorous practice.

Ben Qayin "The work that is being presented in "The Book of Smokeless Fire" is based on a very little known and overlooked Solomonic text simply known as "Miscelaneo de Salomon," which amazingly mirrors that of Lovecraft's, "Necronomicon" both in content and history. It is an ancient and forbidden Arabian manuscript, that seems was later evolved into the Greek "Goetia" and gives the earliest known account of King Solomon and his binding of the seventy-two sinister Djinn he sealed away in the infamous brass container. In "The Book of Smokeless Fire," the ancient manuscript has now been reworked into a completely new system, utilizing revolutionary evocation technology, to again call upon the ancient and destructive Djinn, whose names have been concealed for centuries..." Author S. Ben Qayin has outdone himself with this stunning interpretation and cohesive reworking of a long lost magickal discipline. The Book of Smokeless Fire is over 190 pages of pure magickal knowledge laid out in an easy to read format that really flows. With no fluff, filler, and no nonsense, Qayin manages to take what some have dabbled in and written about in the past and open it up into a fully workable system of magick.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Geometry of Wealth: How to shape a life of money and meaning</h2><p><b>How does money figure into a happy life?</b><br><br>In&nbsp;<i>The Geometry of Wealth</i>,behavioral finance expert Brian Portnoy delivers an inspired answer based on the idea that wealth, truly defined, is <i>funded contentment</i>. It is the ability to underwrite a meaningful life. This stands in stark contrast to angling to become rich, which is usually an unsatisfying treadmill.<br><br>At the heart of this groundbreaking perspective,Portnoy takes readers on a journey toward wealth, informed by disciplines ranging from ancient history to modern neuroscience. He contends that tackling the big questions about a joyful life and tending to financial decisions are complementary, not separate, tasks.&nbsp;<br><br>These big questions include:<br><ul><li>How is the human brain wired for two distinct experiences of happiness? And why can money"buy" one but not the other?</li><li>Are the touchstones of a meaningful life affordable?</li><li>Why is market savvy among the least important sources of wealth but self-awareness is among the most?</li><li>Can we strike a balance between pushing for more and being content with enough?</li></ul>This journey memorably contours along three basic shapes: A circle, triangle and square help us visualize how we adapt to evolving circumstances, set clear priorities, and find empowerment in simplicity. In this accessible and entertaining book, Portnoy reveals that true wealth is achievable for many -including those who despair it is out of reach - but only in the context of a life in which purpose and practice are thoughtfully calibrated.</p><p>Brian Portnoy, PhD, CFA, is an expert at simplifying the complex world of money. In his two books, The Geometry of Wealth and The Investor&#39;s Paradox, he tackles the challenge of not only making better investment decisions but also how money figures into a joyful life. He is currently the Director of Investment Education at Virtus Investment Partners and has spent the last 25 years as educator, investor, and strategist. He holds a doctorate from the University of Chicago and currently lives on the north side of Chicago with his wife and three children."In <i>The Geometry of Wealth</i>, Brian Portnoy has used his incredible talent for translating financial drudgery into simple, accessible, and entertaining prose to help us re-define our satisfaction with money. He has written a book that will leave you truly wealthier for reading it."<br>-Corey Hoffstein, Chief Investment Officer, Newfound Research<br><br>"<i>The Geometry of Wealth</i> walks you through what really matters in our relationship with money. In clear language, simple enough for my kids to understand and sophisticated enough for professionals, Portnoy gets to the heart of the issue. And that&#x2019;s the point - our relationship with money is about what&#x2019;s in our heart and what troubles our mind. Geometry brings it all together in a framework that every reader can follow to live a more contented life."<br>-Ted Seides, Managing Partner, Hidden Brook Investments<br><br>"Managing one&#x2019;s money is an emotionally fraught job, and comes with a confusing lexicon to boot. Is it any wonder so many individuals devote less time to their personal finances than they do planning their next vacation? Brian Portnoy&#x2019;s <i>The Geometry of Wealth</i> makes a bracing assertion: it doesn&#x2019;t have to be this way. In this elegant and insightful volume, he imparts the crucial message that building &#x201c;wealth&#x201d; isn&#x2019;t strictly about money, but finding the intersection between our life&#x2019;s purpose and the funds needed to achieve it. It&#x2019;s essential reading for serious and novice investors alike."<br>-Christine Benz, Morningstar, Director of Personal Finance<br><br>"In <i>The Geometry of Wealth</i>, Brian Portnoy has done something wholly unique and framed the conversation around money in a manner never before previously considered.

For those looking to revolutionize their approach to money and even life, this book receives my highest recommendation."<br>-Dr. Daniel Crosby, NYT bestselling author of The Laws of Wealth<br><br>Portnoy&#x2019;s <i>The Geometry of Wealth</i> is an ensemble of profound wisdom, written in a clear and inviting format, that will inspire anyone who is looking to take responsibility for their own finances and wealth. It masterfully blends psychology, neuroscience, and economics - along with the author&#x2019;s own professional background in investing - to demonstrate that the power to create wealth starts from within. It inherently takes a &#x2018;coach approach&#x2019;, built on self-reflection and enquiry, while offering a goal-focused, practical framework, for actionable insight. I will definitely be recommending this book to any business leader or coach helping their clients through the stages of career and life planning. At last, a book on managing one&#x2019;s own finances, in a way that is both accessible and personal! <br>-Katherine Tulpa, CEO Association for Coaching and Wisdom8<br><br>"Good books about money are few and far between. Great books about money &#x2013; which provide useful investment analysis and helpful personal insight presented powerfully and engagingly &#x2013; are as rare as a bad investment by Warren Buffett, largely because the universe of terrific writers with the academic power and practical experience to write such a book is vanishingly small. <i>The Geometry of Wealth</i> is a great book about money because of who Brian Portnoy is, what he knows, and how well he writes.

Together they spent a combined thirty years in prison before finally being exonerated in 2008. Meanwhile, the real killer remained free.<br><i>The Cadaver King and the Country Dentist</i> recounts the story of how the criminal justice system allowed this to happen, and of how two men, Dr. Steven Hayne and Dr. Michael West, built successful careers on the back of that structure. For nearly two decades, Hayne, a medical examiner, performed the vast majority of Mississippi's autopsies, while his friend Dr. West, a local dentist, pitched himself as a forensic jack-of-all-trades. Together they became the go-to experts for prosecutors and helped put countless Mississippians in prison. But then some of those convictions began to fall apart.<br>Here, Radley Balko and Tucker Carrington tell the haunting story of how the courts and Mississippi's death investigation system--a relic of the Jim Crow era--failed to deliver justice for its citizens. The authors argue that bad forensics, structural racism, and institutional failures are at fault, raising sobering questions about our ability and willingness to address these crucial issues.</p><p><b>Radley Balko</b> is an investigative journalist and reporter at the <i>Washington Post</i>. He currently writes and edits The Watch, a reported opinion blog that covers civil liberties and the criminal justice system.

Since 2006, Balko has written dozens of pieces on Hayne, West, and Mississippi's forensics disaster. His January 2013 investigation, "Solving Kathy Mabry's Murder: Brutal 15-Year-Old Crime Highlights Decades-Long Mississippi Scandal," was one of the most widely read <i>Huffington Post</i> articles of 2013.

He has worked as a criminal defense lawyer for his entire legal career, most of it as a public defender in Washington, D.C."Of all the tragedy documented in this book, surely the most pernicious is the unacknowledged progression of discriminatory policies in the American criminal justice system. The black men at the story's center were not snatched out of a Mississippi jail and lynched. They were falsely imprisoned. They were haunted by state efforts to execute them for three decades. This is a powerful and instructive story, masterfully told by Balko and Carrington."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Ibram X.

The eldest, Bekter, rode a gray mare with skill and concentration, and Temujin matched his pace, waiting for a chance to go past. Behind them came Khasar, whooping wildly as he moved up on the two leaders. At ten, Khasar was a favorite in the tribe, as lighthearted as Bekter was sullen and dark. His red-mottled stallion snorted and whickered after Bekter&#x2019;s mare, making the little boy laugh. Kachiun came next in the galloping line, an eight-year-old not given to the openness that made people love Khasar. Of all of them, Kachiun seemed the most serious, even secretive. He spoke only rarely and did not complain, no matter what Bekter did to him. Kachiun had a knack with the ponies that few others could match, able to nurse a burst of speed when the rest were flagging. Temujin glanced over his shoulder to where Kachiun had positioned himself, his balance perfect. He seemed to be idling along, but they had all been surprised before and Temujin kept a close eye on him.<br><br>Already some way behind his brothers, the smallest and youngest of them could be heard calling plaintively for them to wait. Temuge was a boy with too much love for sweet things and laziness, and it showed in his riding. Temujin grinned at the sight of the chubby boy flapping his arms for more speed. Their mother had warned against including the youngest in their wild tournaments. Temuge had barely grown out of the need to be tied to the saddle, but he wailed if they left him behind. Bekter had yet to find a kind word for Temuge.<br><br>Their high voices carried far across the spring grass of the plain. They galloped flat out, with each boy perched like a bird on the ponies&#x2019; backs. Yesugei had once called them his sparrows and looked on with pride at their skill. Temujin had told Bekter that he was too fat to be a sparrow and had been forced to spend a night hiding out from the older boy&#x2019;s bad temper.<br><br>On such a day, though, the mood of the whole tribe was light. The spring rains had come and the rivers ran full again, winding across plains where dry clay had been only days before. The mares had warm milk for drinking and making into cheese and cool yoghurt. Already, the first touches of green were showing through the bones of the hills, and with it came the promise of a summer and warm days. It was a gathering year, and before the next winter, the tribes would come together in peace to compete and trade. Yesugei had decreed that this year the families of the Wolves would make the trip of more than a thousand miles to replenish their herds. The prospect of seeing the wrestlers and archers was enough to have the boys on their best behavior. The races, though, were what held them rapt and played across their imaginations as they rode. Except for Bekter, the boys had all seen their mother privately, asking Hoelun to put in a word with Yesugei. Each of them wanted to race the long distance or the sprints, to make a name for themselves and be honored.<br><br>It went unspoken that a boy who returned to his gers with a title such as &#x201c;Exalted Rider&#x201d; or &#x201c;Master of Horse&#x201d; might one day win their father&#x2019;s position when he retired to tend his herds. With the possible exception of fat Temuge, the others could not help but dream. It galled Temujin that Bekter assumed he would be the one, as if a year or two of age made a difference. Their relationship had become strained ever since Bekter had returned from his betrothal year away from the tribe. Though Temujin was still the tallest of the brothers, the older boy had grown in some indefinable way, and Temujin had found the new Bekter a humorless companion.<br><br>It had seemed an act at first to Temujin, with Bekter only pretending at maturity. The brooding boy no longer spoke without thinking and seemed to weigh every statement in his mind before he allowed it past his lips. Temujin had mocked his seriousness, but the months of winter had come and gone with no sign of an easing. There were moments when Temujin still found his brother&#x2019;s pompous moods amusing, but he could respect Bekter&#x2019;s temper, if not his right to inherit their father&#x2019;s tents and sword.<br><br>Temujin watched Bekter as he rode, careful not to let a gap grow between them. It was too fine a day to worry about the distant future, and Temujin daydreamed about all four brothers, brothers&#x2013;all five with Bekter, even&#x2013;sweeping the board of honors at the tribal gathering. Yesugei would swell with pride and Hoelun would grip them one by one and call them her little warriors, her little horsemen. Even Temuge could be entered at six years of age, though the risks of a fall were huge. Temujin frowned to himself as Bekter glanced over his shoulder, checking his lead. Despite their subtle maneuvering, Yesugei had not yet given permission for any of them to take part as the spring came.<br><br>Hoelun was pregnant again and close to the end of her time. The pregnancy had been hard on her and quite different from the ones before. Each day began and ended with her retching over a bucket until her face was speckled with spots of blood under the skin. Her sons were on their best behavior while they waited for Yesugei to cease his worried pacing outside the gers. In the end, the khan had grown tired of their stares and careful silence, sending them off to run the winter out of the horses. Temujin had continued to chatter and Yesugei had picked him up in one powerful hand and tossed him at a stallion with a white sock. Temujin had twisted in the air to land and launch into a gallop in one movement. Whitefoot was a baleful, snappy beast, but his father had known he was the boy&#x2019;s favorite.<br><br>Yesugei had watched the others mount without a sign of his pride on his broad, dark face. Like his father before him, he was not a man to show emotion, especially not to sons he could make weak. It was part of a father&#x2019;s responsibility to be feared, though there were times when he ached to hug the boys and throw them up into the air. Knowing which horses they preferred showed his affection, and if they guessed at his feelings from a glance or a light in his eye, that was no more than his own father had done years before. He valued those memories in part for their rarity and could still recall the time his father had finally grunted approval at his knots and ropework with a heavy load. It was a small thing, but Yesugei thought of the old man whenever he yanked a rope tight, his knee hard into the bales. He watched his boys ride into the bright sunshine, and when they could no longer see him, his expression eased. His father had known the need for hard men in a hard land. Yesugei knew they would have to survive battle, thirst, and hunger if they were to reach manhood. Only one could be khan of the tribe. The others would either bend the knee or leave with just a wanderer&#x2019;s gift of goats and sheep. Yesugei shook his head at the thought, gazing after the dust trail of his sons&#x2019; ponies. The future loomed over them, while they saw only the spring and the green hills.<br><br>The sun was bright on his face as Temujin galloped. He reveled in the lift in spirit that came from a fast horse straining under him, the wind in his face. Ahead, he saw Bekter&#x2019;s gray mare recover from a stumble on a loose stone. His brother reacted with a sharp blow to the side of the mare&#x2019;s head, but they had lost a length and Temujin whooped as if he were about to ride past. It was not the right moment. He loved to lead, but he also enjoyed pressuring Bekter, because of the way it annoyed him.<br><br>Bekter was already almost the man he would be, with wide, muscular shoulders and immense stamina. His betrothal year with the Olkhun&#x2019;ut people had given him an aura of worldly knowledge he never failed to exploit. It irritated Temujin like a thorn under his skin, especially when his brothers pestered Bekter with questions about their mother&#x2019;s people and their customs. Temujin too wanted to know, but he decided grimly that he would wait to find out on his own, when Yesugei took him.<br><br>When a young warrior returned from his wife&#x2019;s tribe, he was given the status of a man for the first time. When the girl came into her blood, she would be sent after him with an honor guard to show her value. A ger would be ready for her and her young husband would wait at its door to take her inside.<br><br>For the Wolves, it was tradition for the young man to challenge his khan&#x2019;s bondsmen before he was fully accepted as a warrior. Bekter had been eager and Temujin remembered watching in awe as Bekter had walked up to the bondsmen&#x2019;s fire, close to Yesugei&#x2019;s ger. Bekter had nodded to them and three men had stood to see if his time with the Olkhun&#x2019;ut had weakened him. From the shadows, Temujin had watched, with Khasar and Kachiun silent at his side. Bekter had wrestled all three of the bondsmen, one after the other, taking terrible punishment without complaint. Eeluk had been the last, and the man was like a pony himself, a wall of flat muscle and wide arms. He had thrown Bekter so hard that blood had run from one of his ears, but then to Temujin&#x2019;s surprise, Eeluk had helped Bekter up and held a cup of hot black <i>airag </i>for him to drink. Bekter had almost choked at the bitter fluid mingling with his own blood, but the warriors had not seemed to mind.<br><br>Temujin had enjoyed witnessing his older brother beaten almost senseless, but he saw too that the men no longer scorned him around the fires at night. Bekter&#x2019;s courage had won him something intangible but important. As a result, he had become a stone in Temujin&#x2019;s path. As the brothers raced across the plains under a spring sun, there was no finishing line, as there would be at the great gathering of tribes. Even if there had been, it was too soon after winter to really push their mounts. They all knew better than to exhaust the ponies before they had a little summer fat and good green grass in their bellies. This was a race away from chores and responsibilities, and it would leave them with nothing but arguments about who had cheated, or should have won. Bekter rode almost upright, so that he seemed peculiarly motionless as the horse galloped under him. It was an illusion, Temujin knew. Bekter&#x2019;s hands on the reins were guiding subtly, and his gray mare was fresh and strong. He would take some beating. Temujin rode as Khasar did, low on the saddle, so that he was practically flat against the horse&#x2019;s neck. The wind seemed to sting a little more and both boys preferred the position.<br><br>Temujin sensed Khasar moving up on his right shoulder. He urged the last breath of speed from Whitefoot, and the little pony snorted with something like anger as it galloped. Temujin could see Khasar&#x2019;s pony out of the corner of his eye, and he considered veering slightly, as if by accident. Khasar seemed to sense his intention and lost a length as he moved away, leaving Temujin grinning. They knew each other too well to race, he sometimes thought. He could see Bekter glance back and their eyes met for a second. Temujin raised his eyebrows and showed his teeth.<br><br>&#x201c;I am coming,&#x201d; he called. &#x201c;Try to stop me!&#x201d;<br><br>Bekter turned his back on him, stiff with dislike. It was something of a rarity to have Bekter come riding with them, but as he was there, Temujin could see he was determined to show the &#x201c;children&#x201d; how a warrior could ride. He would not take a loss easily, which was why Temujin would strain every muscle and sinew to beat him. Khasar had gained on both of them, and before Temujin could move to block him, he had almost drawn level. The two boys smiled at each other, confirming that they shared the joy of the day and the speed. The long, dark winter was behind, and though it would come back too soon, they would have this time and take pleasure in it. There was no better way to live. The tribe would eat fat mutton and the herds would birth more sheep and goats for food and trade. The evenings would be spent fletching arrows or braiding horsetails into twine; in song or listening to stories and the history of the tribes. Yesugei would ride against any young Tartars who raided their herds, and the tribe would move lightly on the plains, from river to river. There would be work, but in summer the days were long enough to give hours free to waste, a luxury they never seemed to find in the cold months. What was the point in wandering away to explore when a wild dog might find and bite you in the night? That had happened to Temujin when he was only a little older than Kachiun, and the fear had stayed with him.<br><br>It was Khasar who saw that Temuge had fallen, glancing back in case Kachiun was staging a late rush for the grass crown. Khasar claimed to have the sharpest eyes of the tribe, and he saw that the sprawled speck was not moving, making a decision in an instant. He whistled high-low to Bekter and Temujin, letting them know he was pulling out. Both boys looked back and then farther to where Temuge lay in a still heap. Temujin and his older brother shared a moment of indecision, neither willing to give the race to the other. Bekter shrugged as if it did not matter and reined his mare into a wide circle back the way they had come. Temujin matched him exactly and they galloped as a pair behind the others, the leaders become the led. It was Kachiun now who rode first amongst them, though Temujin doubted the boy even thought of it. At eight, Kachiun was closest in age to Temuge and had spent many long evenings teaching him the names of things in the gers, demonstrating an unusual patience and kindness. Perhaps as a result, Temuge spoke better than many boys of his age, though he was hopeless with the knots Kachiun&#x2019;s quick fingers tried to show him. The youngest of Yesugei&#x2019;s sons was clumsy, and if any of them had been asked to guess at the identity of a fallen rider, they would have said &#x201c;Temuge&#x201d; without a moment&#x2019;s hesitation.<br><br>Temujin jumped from his saddle as he reached the others. Kachiun was already on the ground with Khasar, lifting the supine Temuge into a sitting position.<br><br>The little boy&#x2019;s face was very pale and bruised-looking. Kachiun slapped him gently, wincing as Temuge&#x2019;s head lolled.<br><br>&#x201c;Wake up, little man,&#x201d; Kachiun told his brother, but there was no response. Temujin&#x2019;s shadow fell across them and Kachiun deferred to him immediately.<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t see him fall,&#x201d; he said, as if his seeing would have helped. Temujin nodded, his deft hands feeling Temuge for broken bones or signs of a wound. There was a lump on the side of his head, hidden by the black hair. Temujin prodded at it.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s knocked out, but I can&#x2019;t feel a break. Give me a little water for him.&#x201d;<br><br>He held out a hand and Khasar pulled a leather bottle from a saddlecloth, drawing the stopper with his teeth. Temujin dribbled the warm liquid into Temuge&#x2019;s open mouth.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t choke him,&#x201d; Bekter advised, reminding them he was still mounted, as if he supervised the others.<br><br>Temujin didn&#x2019;t trouble to reply. He was filled with dread as to what their mother Hoelun would say if Temuge died. They could hardly give her such news while her belly was filled with another child. She was weak from sickness and Temujin thought the shock and grief might kill her, yet how could they hide it? She doted on Temuge and her habit of feeding him the sweet yoghurt curds was part of the reason for his chubby flesh.<br><br>Without warning, Temuge choked and spat water. Bekter made an irritable sound with his lips, tired of the children&#x2019;s games. The rest of them beamed at each other.<br><br>&#x201c;I dreamed of the eagle,&#x201d; Temuge said.<br><br>Temujin nodded at him. &#x201c;That is a good dream,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;but you must learn to ride, little man.

Stein, Mad Scientist books zaps fans with another new series, this time about a girl braving the trials and tribulations of middle school. Told in knee-slapping diary entries, the first installment of Jamie Kelly's tales begins as "the worst thing that can happen to you in middle school" almost occurs: getting a nasty nickname (for all of you uneducated souls out there). From there, Jamie goes on to describe a schoolmate's misfortune of using ChocoMint lip smacker; her interest in almost-hunk boy Hudson Rivers; and most of all her unkind feelings toward Angeline, a pretty blonde girl who Jamie's sure is "scorpion-like" beneath her sweet exterior. But when a mysterious culprit smacks the school's cafeteria monitor in her "neck blubber" with meatloaf, Jamie takes the heat and winds up almost-pals with Angeline. Jim Benton delivers a wonderfully silly series that combines his knack for knowing what kids love to read with fun illustrations. Young audiences will eat up Jamie's diary descriptions of stealing Angeline's hair out of the wastebasket, her "glazed" cousin, and just about every other crazy event that happens, while parents are sure to see their kids beg for more Dumb Diary books.

Her keen dark eyes searched the dense woods. Her favorite bow&#x2014;its limbs made of curved, polished olive wood&#x2014;was at the ready. A tooled leather quiver of arrows was slung across her back. She could pull one out and have it nocked and aimed in a split second, as soon as it was needed.<br> <br>Behind her, Artemis heard Athena whizzing along in winged sandals as well.

Getting only two was a B, one a C, and coming up empty meant having to repeat the test until they got it right. Artemis had never ever gotten less than an A in the Beast-ology games, and she didn&#x2019;t want this to be an exception. Today was her birthday, after all. Another A would be the perfect gift to herself.<br> <br>As she entered a clearing, Artemis heard a snuffling sound. The gray-green leaves of a nearby grove of olive trees rustled, disturbing finches and warblers, which flew away in a great flutter of wings. She slowed, motioning silently to her friends to alert them that something was up.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s lurking. Over there!&#x201d; Artemis called softly as the others drew up beside her. Just then the wind changed direction, and she got a whiff of the creature. Ugh. It smelled like swamp gas, wet dog, and cow patties all rolled into one.<br> <br>Persephone groaned and fanned her hand in front of her naturally pale face, causing the bangs of her curly red hair to flutter. &#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t exactly smell like flowers, does it?&#x201d; A skilled gardener, she could make anything bloom at the touch of a finger.<br> <br>Athena wrinkled her nose. &#x201c;Maybe like skunkweed.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I hope it doesn&#x2019;t turn out to be something that slings slime this time,&#x201d; whispered Aphrodite. Flipping her long, shiny blond hair over one shoulder, she touched the gold braid edging the neckline of her chiton. &#x201c;This outfit is new and I don&#x2019;t want it ruined.&#x201d; The goddessgirl of beauty, she liked to dress well. She had an outfit for every occasion. This one was a bright robin&#x2019;s egg blue that matched her eyes. Circling her slender waist was a belt made of woven grapevines. Since Aphrodite set most fashion trends at Mount Olympus Academy, every goddessgirl at school would probably be wearing a belt just like it before the week was out.<br> <br>Stomp. Stomp. Stomp. The ground shook as the beast lumbered closer. Goose bumps rose on Artemis&#x2019;s arms. She&#x2019;d rather eat a scarab beetle than admit it aloud, but she was scared. Because she was goddess of the hunt and was skilled at archery, everyone at school assumed she was brave. Her friends depended on her to lead them in these hunts. Even now the others were waiting for her to tell them what kind of beast they&#x2019;d found. And she had a hunch she knew what it was!<br> <br>Raising her left hand overhead, she held up one finger. Then, after a moment&#x2019;s pause, two fingers. Another pause. Three fingers. And finally, four. Then, holding up her other hand she showed two more fingers to make six in all. This signaled to the others that they&#x2019;d probably found a one-headed, two-armed, three-bodied, four-winged, six-legged beast. Just in case they hadn&#x2019;t gotten the message, she silently mouthed the beast&#x2019;s name: Geryon.<br> <br>At the news, Athena got the determined look on her face that she always did just before taking a test she wanted to ace. Persephone pinched her nose closed, as if preparing for the worst smell ever to get even worse as their opponent came closer. And Aphrodite glanced down at her stylish blue chiton, looking more than a trifle concerned.<br> <br>Seconds later a giant creature jumped out of the woods into the clearing. At the sight of it, goose bumps rose on top of the goose bumps Artemis already had. The Geryon was big. It was bad. It was beastly. It looked just like the one whose features she&#x2019;d memorized from her Beast-ology textscroll.<br> <br>Although she loved to hunt, she wished they&#x2019;d shoot at regular targets. Sometimes the beasts Professor Ladon designed for these tests seemed so . . . so real. She had a hard time remembering they were fake.<br> <br>&#x201c;You called this one right as usual,&#x201d; confirmed Athena from behind her. &#x201c;Watch out, the class textscroll says they have particularly vicious talons and wily ways.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And bad breath,&#x201d; added Aphrodite, holding her nose now along with Persephone.<br> <br>The Geryon licked its green lips, eyeing them each in turn. Then it turned and waggled its three rear ends so its trio of long tails swept back and forth in the leaves. &#x201c;Nah nah nuh nah nah,&#x201d; it taunted softly. All the while, its blazing red eyes watched them over its shoulder to see if they&#x2019;d take the bait and move closer. When they didn&#x2019;t, it held a hand toward them. It poked one foreclaw out and curled it over and over, beckoning them to follow it into the intricate maze of bushes beyond it known as the labyrinth. There was rumored to be some sort of fantastical beast-making machine in the center, which Professor Ladon had specially designed to spawn their opponents for these games.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ye gods,&#x201d; Athena whispered. &#x201c;Does it really think we&#x2019;ll fall for that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No way we&#x2019;re following it into that maze,&#x201d; Artemis agreed, her voice shaking. Then, worried that her words might have sounded cowardly, she added in a confident voice, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s try to lure it closer. I&#x2019;d like to get a good shot at that big green patoot.&#x201d;<br> <br>Persephone giggled, but with her nose pinched tight, it sounded more like a snore.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, but not too close,&#x201d; said Aphrodite, glancing nervously down at her chiton again. The beasts couldn&#x2019;t harm the goddessgirls, who were immortal, after all. Still, these horrible creatures had ways of making students . . . uncomfortable. Artemis had had her hair singed once in third grade and had gotten a rash from a poisonous dart shot from a serpentine tail in fifth.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let me try something,&#x201d; said Persephone. With that, she bent low to a bed of weeds, then blew across it. Seeds encased in fluffy puffs of white whooshed toward the beast. As if on cue, the creature began sneezing. And with each sneeze, it bounced a little closer to them.<br> <br>Persephone grinned. &#x201c;Dandelions. Geryons are allergic to them. Works every time.&#x201d;<br> <br>Suddenly the beast stopped sneezing and let out a huge triple snort from its three giant, hairy nostrils. It planted both hands on its hips. Its eyes flashed red and beady on each of the goddessgirls in turn, as if it was trying to decide who to gobble up first.<br> <br>&#x201c;Uh-oh,&#x201d; said Athena. &#x201c;Somebody looks annoyed.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Quick! Fan out. As a group, we&#x2019;re too easy a target!&#x201d; Artemis told them, trying to keep the panic she felt out of her voice. Not seeming to notice how breathless she sounded, the others took her direction and fanned out around the beast in a semicircle.<br> <br>Persephone, who&#x2019;d probably seen far more fearsome varmints when she visited the Underworld with her friend Hades, kept her cool. &#x201c;Got this one?&#x201d; she called softly to Artemis.<br> <br>Hovering just inches above the ground in her magic sandals, Artemis&#x2019;s fingers trembled as she slipped an arrow from her quiver. &#x201c;Yeah, under control,&#x201d; she murmured with her usual show of bravado. She nocked the single arrow in her bow but didn&#x2019;t pull back the string quite yet. She didn&#x2019;t want to shoot one of her friends by accident! &#x201c;C&#x2019;mon, just a little closer,&#x201d; she crooned, eyeing the beast.<br> <br>The Geryon&#x2019;s eyebrows bunched together like angry caterpillars. It gnashed its five green teeth and pawed its clawed hooves in the grass. But because they&#x2019;d spread out, it couldn&#x2019;t seem to decide who to attack first.<br> <br>That is, until Aphrodite piped up. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s going to charge!&#x201d; Even when she was terrified and shouting, her voice was as beautiful as she was. Drawn by its lovely sound, the Geryon&#x2019;s frightful gaze focused on her. Its lips curved in a gruesome grin. It gnashed and pawed a little more, but this time it was just for show. Clearly, it had chosen a victim. With a mighty lunge, it charged toward Aphrodite. She shrieked again, so scared that she dropped her bow. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s c-coming!&#x201d;<br> <br>Artemis zipped toward her, moving sideways, always facing the Geryon head-on like Professor Ladon had taught them. Never turn your back on a beast. This was one of Mr. Ladon&#x2019;s top ten rules. As the Geryon loomed closer, she pulled back her bowstring, aiming.<br> <br>Oomph! Before she could shoot, she bumped into something. A tree? No, it was Aphrodite! In a tangle of arms and legs, they tumbled to the ground. Although their sandals would whisk them away to safety once they stood, their flight-magic could only flicker listlessly as long as the girls lay sprawled on the moss.<br> <br>Beside her, Aphrodite whimpered, totally vulnerable to attack without her bow. Artemis had managed to hold on to hers, but in the confusion, her arrow had popped from it to land a few feet away. She heard Athena and Persephone calling to them to get up. But for the moment she was frozen, too scared to move. Her eyes locked with the Geryon&#x2019;s as it loomed closer. And closer. Its smell was even more horrific now, and she could feel the heat of its breath even from two dozen yards away. She&#x2019;d once read somewhere about a mortal who&#x2019;d died of fright. Even though she knew that couldn&#x2019;t happen to her, at the moment it seemed very possible. Her heart pounded. A fine sheen of perspiration prickled the back of her neck. She had to do something!<br> <br>From then on things began to happen quickly, yet they seemed to her to move in slow motion. The Geryon was only three yards away now. It leaped in the air, preparing to ruin Aphrodite&#x2019;s new chiton, lower the goddessgirls&#x2019; grades, and generally wreak havoc.<br> <br>Fighting down feelings of terror, Artemis sat up, nocked a new arrow, and squinched one eye shut to aim. She straightened her shaking fingers to release the bowstring.<br> <br>Zzzzzing!<br> <br>Poof! The second her arrow reached it, the monster disappeared into thin air.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes!&#x201d; Artemis exclaimed, her confidence flooding back. &#x201c;Right between its four eyes!&#x201d;<br> <br>Seconds later the Geryon sprang up again at the entrance to the labyrinth, an arrow sticking from its forehead. Grinning now, it calmly plucked out the arrow, tossed it away, and bowed to them. &#x201c;Congratulations, goddessgirls,&#x201d; it said in a tone that was almost friendly. &#x201c;You have now achieved the eighth Level of the Arrow. Your excellent progress will be reported to Professor Ladon in your Beast-ology class at Mount Olympus Academy. Until next time . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>As its last word died away, the fearsome Geryon disappeared in a puff of purple smoke that hung over the labyrinth for a few moments like wispy fog.<br> <br>&#x201c;Another save by Artemis the brave!&#x201d; Athena quipped, sounding relieved.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank godness!&#x201d; Aphrodite added gratefully as Persephone and Athena helped her to stand.<br> <br>Artemis didn&#x2019;t comment. She was thinking about their praise, quite sure she didn&#x2019;t deserve it. Her? Brave? Nuh-uh.<br> <br>&#x201c;You okay?&#x201d; Persephone asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, um, yeah, sure,&#x201d; said Artemis. As soon as she and Aphrodite regained their footing, their sandals&#x2019; magic revived and they rose to hover a few inches from the ground like the other girls.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m not,&#x201d; said Aphrodite, examining her blue-lacquered fingernails with a tragic expression. &#x201c;I broke a nail. I knew there was a reason Beast-ology was my least favorite class.&#x201d; Pulling a magic nail file from the cosmetic bag in her quiver, she held out her hand and let the file whisk expertly around her fingertips, making repairs.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s important, though,&#x201d; said Artemis. &#x201c;Immortals have to learn this kind of stuff.&#x201d; It was true. Even if her courage did sometimes desert her without warning, she was glad the class was required. Putting two fingers between her lips, she whistled for her dogs. A bloodhound, a beagle, and a greyhound came bounding toward her out of the forest.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good boy, Suez!&#x201d; she told her bloodhound, who had retrieved one of her arrows. She&#x2019;d named him for Principal Zeus&#x2014;Suez was Zeus spelled backward&#x2014;because like Zeus, Suez was big and blue-eyed. She hover-knelt a couple of inches from the ground to roughhouse with her dogs, and they bounded around her happily, their tongues hanging out.<br> <br>Persephone hunkered lower too and joined in the pooch-play. &#x201c;Beast-ology is exciting. I&#x2019;ll say that for it,&#x201d; she said, as Amby, the beagle, gave her a slobbery kiss. &#x201c;Even though I know the mythical beasts aren&#x2019;t real, they look, smell, and act so much like real monsters that it&#x2019;s hard to remember this is a class and they&#x2019;re only made of magic.&#x201d;<br> <br>Athena held up both of her hands. &#x201c;You got that right. Look at my hands. They&#x2019;re still shaking. I was terrified, even though I knew that Geryon was a fake.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But that&#x2019;s the whole the point of Mr. Ladon&#x2019;s game! He created the beasts to challenge our skill and bravery,&#x201d; said Artemis. She longed to admit that her hands had trembled too. It would have been a relief to share her fears, but the others had such confidence in her fearlessness that she was too embarrassed to do so. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s great practice. You never know when a real beast will come along and need to be put in its place.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, come on. Have you ever seen even one real beast in your whole life?&#x201d; asked Aphrodite. Studying her nails in satisfaction, she tucked the file away in her quiver. Then she pulled out a hand mirror and began primping, smoothing her hair and touching up her makeup.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, no,&#x201d; Artemis admitted, standing again. In fact, she often wondered if she&#x2019;d be up to the challenge of fighting a real beast, if she actually saw one. It was easy to appear brave and stay relatively cool when faced with fake beasts. But what if, when it really mattered, her bravery seriously failed her?<br> <br>Just then a crooning sigh rippled over the forest, causing leaves to rustle and the moss that hung from the trees to sway. It was the gentle sound of the nymph girls who dwelled in the hawthorn, oak, and willows. One by one, the nymphs began to peek out from behind the tree trunks and between branches, their pale faces glowing like fairy lights.<br> <br>&#x201c;The godboys must be coming,&#x201d; said Artemis, rolling her eyes. Nymphs were notoriously boy c...</p><h2>The Golden Ratio Coloring Book: And Other Mathematical Patterns Inspired by Nature and Art</h2><p><b>The elegance of mathematics meets the creativity of art in this unique coloring book. </b><br> The golden ratio is the mathematical equation that describes what many consider the &#x201c;divine proportion,&#x201d; and it&#x2019;s found throughout nature, as well as in art and architecture.

The whole Christmas season! / Now, please don't ask why. No one quite knows the reason." Dr. Seuss's small-hearted Grinch ranks right up there with Scrooge when it comes to the crankiest, scowling holiday grumps of all time. For 53 years, the Grinch has lived in a cave on the side of a mountain, looming above the Whos in Whoville. The noisy holiday preparations and infernal singing of the happy little citizens below annoy him to no end. The Grinch decides this frivolous merriment must stop. His "wonderful, awful" idea is to don a Santa outfit, strap heavy antlers on his poor, quivering dog Max, construct a makeshift sleigh, head down to Whoville, and strip the chafingly cheerful Whos of their Yuletide glee once and for all.<p> Looking quite out of place and very disturbing in his makeshift Santa get-up, the Grinch slithers down chimneys with empty bags and stealing the Whos' presents, their food, even the logs from their humble Who-fires. He takes the ramshackle sleigh to Mt. Crumpit to dump it and waits to hear the sobs of the Whos when they wake up and discover the trappings of Christmas have disappeared. Imagine the Whos' dismay when they discover the evil-doings of Grinch in his anti-Santa guise. But what is that sound? It's not sobbing, but singing! Children simultaneously adore and fear this triumphant, twisted Seussian testimonial to the undaunted cheerfulness of the Whos, the transcendent nature of joy, and of course, the growth potential of a heart that's two sizes too small. This holiday classic is perfect for reading aloud to your favorite little Whos. <i>(Ages 4 to 8)</i></p>The Grinch, whose heart is two sizes too small, hates Who-ville&#39;s holiday celebrations, and plans to steal all the presents to prevent Christmas from coming. To his amazement, Christmas comes anyway, and the Grinch discovers the true meaning of the holiday.</p><h2>Splat the Cat: Where&#39;s the Easter Bunny?: An Easter And Springtime Book For Kids</h2><p><p><strong>Hop down the bunny trail with Splat the Cat in a funny tale by <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author-artist Rob Scotton in <em>Where&#x2019;s the Easter Bunny?</em>, a lift-the-flap Easter adventure.</strong></p><p>It&#x2019;s almost Easter, and Splat knows exactly what he wants from the Easter Bunny&#x2014;a <em>really</em> big Easter egg.

Small and yellow, it blended in with the waves of sweetgrass and sea oats and the delicate yellow primroses for which the cottage was named. For eighty-five years it had endured the fury of hurricanes, the rush of tidal surges, and the ravages of the salt-tinged air. It had withstood the test of time.<br> <br>The beach house was a survivor.<br> <br>As was she, Cara Rutledge thought, staring up at the house. She held a paintbrush in one hand and, shading her eyes from the gentle rays of the sun with the other, surveyed the fresh coat of gleaming white paint she&#x2019;d just finished applying to the front porch and railings. How many times had she painted these porches? she wondered. Or repaired the pergola, fixed the plumbing, trimmed the shrubs and trees? Living by the sea was a constant exercise in the art of nip and tuck, especially for an old cottage like Primrose. But she didn&#x2019;t mind the time or expense. She would repair and paint it every year she could still lift a paintbrush or afford a plumber. Because even more than the historic house on Tradd Street in Charleston, or the treasured, centuries-old family antiques that filled the Rutledge family&#x2019;s home, this modest 1930s beach house held the real memories of her family.<br> <br>Only the good memories, she corrected herself with a wistful smile as her thoughts floated back to the halcyon days of her childhood.<br> <br>When she was growing up, summer meant leaving the bustle and noise of Charleston and coming out to Primrose Cottage on the Isle of Palms with her mother, Olivia, and older brother, Palmer. It might have been only a trip across the Grace Bridge, some twenty miles, but back in the day, the change was so significant they might as well have journeyed to another country. Many of the girls she knew from school spent summers at family cottages on Sullivan&#x2019;s Island. But her mother claimed she preferred the relative isolation and the maritime forest on Isle of Palms. Cara, too, had preferred the Huck Finn lifestyle of Isle of Palms, where her mother would open the screen door and let her children run wild till the dinner bell at 5 p.m.<br> <br>Cara sighed, slipping into the vortex of memories. Her gaze scanned the quaint cottage under the brilliant azure sky. She had achieved many lifetime firsts here. She&#x2019;d learned to swim on the beach just beyond the house, kissed her first boyfriend on the back porch, confided secrets with her best friend, Emmi, over cookies and sweet tea in the kitchen, broken her first bone falling from the live oak tree that thrived until Hurricane Hugo blew it down. She&#x2019;d caught her first fish from Hamlin Creek on the back of the island, and made love with Brett amid the clicking sea oats on the dunes. Of all her memories, those of the man she&#x2019;d fallen in love with late in life, married, and forged a new life with here on Isle of Palms were the sweetest.<br> <br>Cara closed her eyes and took a deep breath, inhaling the sweet sea air. She heard the sounds of the island&#x2014;the soft humming of bees, the purr of the ocean. She felt the caress of a breeze ruffle her hair. Whenever she had memories of the beach house, the image of her mother formed in her mind. Olivia Rutledge, affectionately known as Lovie&#x2014;slight, ageless, her blond hair pulled back into a stylish chignon, her blue eyes shining with warmth. Opening her eyes, Cara almost expected to see her mother walking around the corner carrying the red turtle team bucket.<br> <br>Primrose Cottage had been her mother&#x2019;s beach house. No, Cara thought on reflection. More than her house. The cottage had been her mother&#x2019;s sanctuary. Her place of refuge. Her source of inspiration. Lovie had come here to escape the burdens of her social obligations in Charleston. On the island she was free to pursue her passion&#x2014;sea turtles. Lovie had been the Isle of Palms&#x2019;s first &#x201c;sea turtle lady.&#x201d; She&#x2019;d formed the first turtle team. She&#x2019;d even named her only daughter Caretta, after the Latin name for the loggerhead, much to Cara&#x2019;s lifelong chagrin.<br> <br>They&#x2019;d been close when she was young, but as Cara grew tall and statuesque, her opinions matured as well. She&#x2019;d found herself growing increasingly distant from her mother&#x2014;in fact, from both her parents.<br> <br>Especially her father.<br> <br>When Cara was eighteen, to her traditional father Stratton Rutledge&#x2019;s disappointment, she had refused to become the southern belle she was expected to be. Her hair was too dark, her feet too big. She was too tall, too bookish, and far too independent-minded. After graduating high school with honors, Cara had informed her parents, in a tone of voice that implied she was well aware they would not approve, that she wasn&#x2019;t going to the local college they&#x2019;d selected for her but would instead attend a northeastern college. Perhaps Boston University. Maybe even Harvard. She was proud she&#x2019;d been accepted. Her father, however, wasn&#x2019;t accustomed to back talk, especially from his daughter.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who the hell do you think you are, little girl?&#x201d; he&#x2019;d roared, his voice echoing in the large dining room of their grand home. Her mother had sat quietly at the other end of the table, her eyes meekly downcast. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll do as I say. And if you step one foot outside this town&#x2014;out of this house&#x2014;that&#x2019;ll tear it between us, you hear? You leave and you&#x2019;ll not get one dollar, not one stick of furniture, not so much as a nod of the head when you pass me or your mother on the street, hear?&#x201d;<br> <br>But Cara was more like her father than he&#x2019;d realized. She&#x2019;d turned heel and run as far away from her parents, that house, Charleston, and all the expectations and demands of a southern woman from South of Broad as she could get, heading to points north to seek her freedom, fame, and fortune. Her father was as good as his word. He&#x2019;d cut her off and never looked back. He refused to pay her tuition, so she&#x2019;d never gone to a prestigious Boston college. Instead she&#x2019;d nailed an interview for an entry-level position at an advertising firm in Chicago, and had gone to night school for seven years while working full-time, finally earning her degree in communications. She&#x2019;d climbed the corporate ladder and, though she wasn&#x2019;t wealthy, she&#x2019;d achieved success on her own merit. Cara had come home only once, for her brother&#x2019;s wedding, and sent a handful of Christmas and birthday cards over the years. There was the occasional phone call with her mother. Her relationship with her family was polite at best.<br> <br>When her father died, Cara returned home for his funeral. Like the man he&#x2019;d been throughout his lifetime, his will was cold and vindictive. As Stratton had sworn all those years ago, he didn&#x2019;t leave her as much as a stick of furniture. Cara had neither expected nor wanted anything from him. But the silence from her mother upon finding out that he&#x2019;d made good on his pledge had hurt.<br> <br>Then, on Cara&#x2019;s fortieth birthday, her mother had written asking her to come home for a visit. And she&#x2019;d obliged. A weekend at the beach house had turned into a summer of reconciliation.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, Mama,&#x201d; she whispered so softly that her voice was carried off by the breeze. Cara had lost Lovie again to cancer right after they&#x2019;d found each other once more. Even after ten years, Cara&#x2019;s heart yearned for her.<br> <br>Her father had left everything to Palmer. But the beach house was her mother&#x2019;s, and when Lovie died she&#x2019;d left it to Cara, knowing she would care for Primrose Cottage&#x2014;and all the secrets associated with it&#x2014;with the love and attention to detail that Lovie herself had exhibited. And Cara had fulfilled that promise.<br> <br>Studying the beach house in the softening light of day&#x2019;s end, Cara shook her head ruefully. If someone had told her when she was eighteen that decades later she&#x2019;d be back on the Isle of Palms as mistress of Primrose Cottage, she would have laughed out loud with disbelief.<br> <br>But here she was, turning fifty, living on the Isle of Palms again, married to the love of her life and giving Primrose Cottage yet another coat of paint. &#x201c;What goes around comes around,&#x201d; her mother used to say. Cara chortled and shook her head. As usual, her mother was right.<br> <br>Cara rolled her stiff shoulders, then traipsed across the sand and wildflowers to the waiting bucket of soapy water. She set her brush to soak, then put her hands on her back and once again stretched her aching muscles. Fifty certainly wasn&#x2019;t the new forty, not in Cara&#x2019;s opinion anyway.<br> <br>No more daydreaming, she told herself as her usual practical, no-nonsense attitude kicked in. Rental season was around the corner and there was a lot left to do&#x2014;and she couldn&#x2019;t afford to hire anyone else. She was committed to keeping the beach house up to the standards set by her mother. Still, she&#x2019;d miscalculated the strength of the early spring sun and she could feel the pinpricks of sunburn on her arms.<br> <br>The sound of a car pulling up the gravel driveway distracted her. She stopped studying her arm and looked over her shoulder to see her brother&#x2019;s gleaming white Mercedes sedan easing to a stop. He gave a gentle toot of the horn to herald his arrival. She chuckled, thinking Palmer always arrived with fanfare. She removed the man&#x2019;s denim shirt irretrievably splattered with paint, one of Brett&#x2019;s rejects, from over her black T-shirt and tossed it on a nearby wheelbarrow. The front car door swung open and one polished slip-on tasseled loafer peeked out from the car, then Palmer Rutledge hoisted himself out with a muffled grunt.<br> <br>At fifty-two, Palmer was two years older than Cara, but he looked a good decade older, thanks to the bloated, florid face and the paunch at his waist from his lifestyle as a businessman and successful real estate maven. While his habits had led to a less-than-healthy physique, Cara couldn&#x2019;t deny that Palmer had an enviable sense of style. Even as a boy he&#x2019;d always been an impeccable dresser, a sharp contrast to Cara&#x2019;s tattered, beachy sartorial choices. Today he wore a tan golf jacket over a polo shirt and pressed khakis. Cara wiped the flecks of paint from her hands onto her torn jeans and took a step toward him, a smile of welcome spread across her tanned face.<br> <br>&#x201c;Palmer!&#x201d; she exclaimed with an exuberant wave. &#x201c;Come to see how the other half lives?&#x201d;<br> <br>Her brother held out his arms and she walked into them for a bear hug, highlighting the physical ease and sense of closeness that they shared as children remained. Cara believed their mother&#x2019;s death had made them not simply orphans, but all too aware of their own mortality.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s enough of that,&#x201d; Palmer said with a low laugh, gently disentangling himself. &#x201c;You smell ripe, sister mine.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; Cara replied breezily, not in the least embarrassed. &#x201c;Comes from decent hard work.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mama never lifted a paintbrush in her delicate hands.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mama had more money than me. And, brother mine, I believe you do, too. So if the sight of my chipped nails and paint-splattered clothes offends you, kindly offer me the funds to hire out.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d love to, honey, but we both know Julia spends every penny I earn faster than sand through fingers.&#x201d; Palmer rolled his eyes as he so often did when speaking of his socially conscious, designer-driven wife. His gaze shifted to the cottage. &#x201c;Nice job,&#x201d; he said. Then he slanted her a look. &#x201c;Do you hire out?&#x201d;<br> <br>Cara slapped his arm teasingly. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t get me started.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Seriously,&#x201d; Palmer said, crossing his arms over his belly, &#x201c;the place looks good. Real good.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a pretty place,&#x201d; she said, looking again at the beach house. And it was true. With its mullioned windows and broad porch filled with baskets of ferns and white rockers, she&#x2019;d always thought that it was a picturesque image of a lowcountry cottage. &#x201c;Say what you will about all these mansions,&#x201d; she said with another wave of her hand, indicating the enormous newer houses. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t buy that old-world charm.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You ever been in those big houses?&#x201d; Palmer teased. He looked around, searching. &#x201c;So where&#x2019;s your better half?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Brett is out back building a new pergola over the enclosed back porch. He&#x2019;s worked so hard on it. It&#x2019;s almost done, and I have to say it turned out so well.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Wait,&#x201d; Palmer said, holding up his hand. &#x201c;What enclosed porch?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t seen it yet, have you?&#x201d; Cara asked in surprise. Though Palmer and Julia lived just over the bridge in Charleston with their two children, Linnea and Cooper, she and they didn&#x2019;t spend time together outside of family events and holidays. Cara doted on her niece and nephew, but with school and social schedules it seemed everyone was always too busy. &#x201c;Come on &#x2019;round. Brett will want to show it off. He did all the work himself.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That man sure is handy,&#x201d; Palmer said as he followed her.<br> <br>Cara knew he meant it as a compliment. Palmer had tried for years to get Brett involved in flipping houses, especially on the islands. But Brett was as stubborn as he was talented. He truly loved working with wood. He was as much a craftsman as a builder. Like so much else in his life, he did things his own way and wouldn&#x2019;t be hurried.<br> <br>She led the way around the cottage, her shoes crunching in the dry sand and shells. Cara kept the property wild, as nature had intended. Only palm trees, wild grasses, and flowers sprouted on her property, especially in the spring, when the island was practically bursting with life. Wildflowers colored the dunes with soft yellows, vibrant blues, and fiery oranges. In the trees birds sang out mating calls, while overhead migrating birds soared, returning home from southern climes.<br> <br>This side of the beach house faced the long stretch of dunes that reached out to the Atlantic Ocean. The mighty sea reflected the mood of the sky&#x2014;sometimes dark, turbulent, and gloomy, other times a soft, introspective gray-blue. Today the water was the color of unbridled joy and hope, a blue so vivid the horizon line disappeared where sea met sky, creating an infinite stretch of blue. Sunlight danced on the ocean, making it appear a living, breathing thing. Cara paused to stare out in awe. The dazzling sea always had the power to take her breath away.<br> <br>&#x201c;Beautiful day,&#x201d; Palmer said with gusto, rocking back on his heels and echoing her thoughts.<br> <br>&#x201c;It is,&#x201d; she replied softly, sharing the moment with her brother.<br> <br>&#x201c;And a stunning view. I&#x2019;ve always said that,&#x201d; he added, then gestured toward the ocean. &#x201c;No houses standing in the way. You&#x2019;ve got a straight shot to the sea with that vacant lot in front of you.&#x201d;<br> <br>His words broke through her quiet reverie as she realized Palmer wasn&#x2019;t appreciating the spiritual quality of the view, but rather the commercial value. He spoke as if she didn&#x2019;t realize all these fine points of her own home. Going for the hard sell, as always. She turned her head to scrutinize him.<br> <br>Her brother was, in fact, wearing business attire, she suddenly realized, not the sporty shorts and Tommy Bahama shirts he wore for leisure. His gold signet ring caught the sunlight and drew her attention to the papers he was carrying in his doughy hand. Cara sighed inwardly, even as she steeled her resolve.<br> <br>This wasn&#x2019;t a social call. Palmer had come on business. Without speaking, she turned the corner of the house toward the back.<br> <br>&#x201c;Whoa,&#x201d; Palmer exclaimed. He paused, hands on hips, to ta...</p><h2>Have You Felt Like Giving Up Lately?: Hope &amp; Healing When You Feel Discouraged</h2><p>Everyone experiences times of sadness, trials, and pain.

Extremely tall skeletons ranging from 7 feet up to a staggering 18 feet tall have been reportedly uncovered in prehistoric mounds, burial chambers, caves, geometric earthworks, and ancient battlefields. Strange anatomic anomalies such as double rows of teeth, horned skulls, massive jaws that fit over a modern face, and elongated skulls have also been reported. Many of these discoveries were sent to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C., seemingly never to be heard about again. The Smithsonian's own records describe at least 17 giant skeletons in annual reports. This book examines a possible cover-up initiated by Smithsonian scientists starting in the late 1800s. The origins of &#x201c;the tall ones&#x201d; has been shrouded in mystery for centuries, but this book reveals where they came from, why they got so large, and the reason for their downfall, using the latest scientific research, genetic data, native myths, news reports, and ethnological research. This has become one of the most gripping stories of the last few centuries and for the first time the truth of the giants of North America has been revealed. This book also reveals: - How early explorers to America witnessed these giants first-hand, including Sir Francis Drake, John Smith and even some of the early presidents. - Legends and myths that talk of cannibalistic, red-haired giants. - Strange inscriptions, metal armor, mummified remains, and sophisticated technologies buried with the skeletons. - How secret societies such as the Rosicrucians, Freemasons and Theosophists all claim the existence of giant humans in the past as historical fact in their literature. - How the giants may be connected to the Denisovans from Siberia, the Nephilim of Bible tradition, and other ancient cultures.</p><p>JIM VIEIRA is a stonemason, researcher and writer.

A perfect addition to the ancient mysteries bookshelf." - <b>Andrew Collins</b>, author of <i>Gobekli Tepe: Genesis of the Gods</i></p><h2>You Don&#39;t Have to Say You Love Me: A Memoir</h2><p><b>The Instant <i>New York Times</i> Bestseller</b><br><b>A searing, deeply moving memoir about family, love, loss, and forgiveness from the critically acclaimed, bestselling National Book Award-winning author of <i>The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian</i>.</b><br><br> Family relationships are never simple. But Sherman Alexie's bond with his mother Lillian was more complex than most. She plunged her family into chaos with a drinking habit, but shed her addiction when it was on the brink of costing her everything. She survived a violent past, but created an elaborate facade to hide the truth. She selflessly cared for strangers, but was often incapable of showering her children with the affection that they so desperately craved. She wanted a better life for her son, but it was only by leaving her behind that he could hope to achieve it. It's these contradictions that made Lillian Alexie a beautiful, mercurial, abusive, intelligent, complicated, and very human woman.<br><br>When she passed away, the incongruities that defined his mother shook Sherman and his remembrance of her. Grappling with the haunting ghosts of the past in the wake of loss, he responded the only way he knew how: he wrote. The result is a stunning memoir filled with raw, angry, funny, profane, tender memories of a childhood few can imagine, much less survive. An unflinching and unforgettable remembrance, YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY YOU LOVE ME is a powerful, deeply felt account of a complicated relationship. <br></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of June 2017:</strong> Sherman Alexie's memoir, <em>You Don&#x2019;t Have to Say You Love Me</em>, is an extraordinary look at the complicated relationship between a remarkable mother and an equally remarkable son, set, mostly, in the Spokane Indian Reservation where Alexie spent his childhood. His whip-smart, sometimes cruel mother saved the family when she stopped drinking, but was inexplicably tough on her kids &#x2013; something Alexie traces back to mental illness, sexual assault, and the Indian experience of violence and oppression. Family memoirs often seem like an opportunity for score settling, but Alexie is so aware of his own fallible memory and his own imperfections that this one won&#x2019;t make you bristle. His style is idiosyncratic &#x2013; passages of verse lead to passages of prose -- but it&#x2019;s readable, unpretentious, funny and deeply compassionate. <em>--Sarah Harrison Smith, The Amazon Book Review</em>Winner of the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction, the PEN/Malamud Award for Short Fiction, a PEN/Hemingway Citation for Best First Fiction, and the National Book Award for Young People's Literature, Sherman Alexie is a poet, short story writer, novelist and performer. A Spokane/Couer d'Alene Indian, Alexie grew up in Wellpinit, Washington, on the Spokane Indian Reservation. Alexie has been an urban Indian since 1994 and lives in Seattle with his family. <br></p><h2>Singapore Math &#x2013; Level 2B Math Practice Workbook for 3rd Grade, Paperback, Ages 8&#x2013;9 with Answer Key</h2><p><p><strong>GRADE 3/AGES 8&#x2013;9:</strong> Helps third grade students master math with grade-appropriate practice and activities based on the Singapore Math method.</p> <p><strong>INCLUDES:</strong> Learning objectives and unit assessments are included to ensure that students obtain a thorough understanding of each concept, as well as an answer key with step-by-step solutions that help students see how to work the problems.</p> <p><strong>WHY SINGAPORE MATH:</strong> The math curriculum in Singapore has been recognized worldwide for its excellence in producing students highly skilled in mathematics.

Father announces from behind his newspaper. Out a picture window, his son and his son's pet hamster can see a hamster family (with kids numbered 1 to 10) approaching the house. "All aboard!" shouts the boy's prized pet, as his puzzled owner opens the door and the hamster tourists are loaded onto the special trolley. What the humans at 1 Hoppin Place don't know is that their cherished family pet has advertised on the Web (www.hamstertours.com) for a "10-Minute Bedtime Tour," and the hordes have only just begun to descend.<p> "Nine minutes till bedtime," Father insists, oblivious to the burgeoning hamster parade. At the 8-minute marker, the hamsters and the boy are in the kitchen for a pre-bedtime snack. One little guy is standing on top of a fruit bowl, lowering a cherry cluster with a string and paper clip. Hamster number 10 is trying to feed an animal cracker to the boy's fuzzy bedroom slipper. "Seven minutes till bedtime!" reminds Father as creative tooth-brushing progresses. But what's this? It's the 5-minute countdown marker, and the faint light of hamster headlights appears out the window. More tourists are on their way! Buses, trucks, taxis, and golf carts full of rodents are driving up the sidewalk! Hilarious hamster hijinks ensue. If you're not seeing the appeal here, it's like this: each spread is turbocharged with dozens of winsome, adorable details that will keep youngsters giggling and entranced--and counting to 10--time after time. Peggy Rathmann, author of the Caldecott Medal-winning <i>Officer Buckle and Gloria</i>, offers readers a rollicking rodent romp that ends with a goodnight kiss and many, many closed eyelids.

(Ages 2 to 8) <i>--Karin Snelson</i></p>Caldecott-medalist Peggy Rathmann was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, and grew up in the suburbs with two brothers and two sisters.<p>"In the summer we lolled in plastic wading pools guzzling Kool-Aid. In the winter we sculpted giant snow animals. It was a good life."</p><p>Ms. Rathmann graduated from Mounds View High School in New Brighton, Minnesota, then attended colleges everywhere, changing her major repeatedly. She eventually earned a B.A. in psychology from the University of Minnesota.</p><p>"I wanted to teach sign language to gorillas, but after taking a class in signing, I realized what I'd rather do was draw pictures of gorillas."</p><p>Ms. Rathmann studied commercial art at the American Academy in Chicago, fine art at the Atelier Lack in Minneapolis, and children's-book writing and illustration at the Otis Parsons School of Design in Los Angeles.</p><p>"I spent the first three weeks of my writing class at Otis Parsons filching characters from my classmates' stories. Finally, the teacher convinced me that even a beginning writer can create an original character if the character is driven by the writer's most secret weirdness. Eureka! A little girl with a passion for plagiarism! I didn't want anyone to know it was me, so I made the character look like my sister."</p><p>The resulting book, <b>Ruby the Copycat</b>, earned Ms. Rathmann the "Most Promising New Author" distinction in <i>Publishers Weekly</i>'s 1991 annual Cuffie Awards. In 1992 she illustrated <b>Bootsie Barker Bites</b> for Barbara Bottner, her teacher at Otis Parsons.</p><p>A homework assignment produced an almost wordless story, <b>Good Night, Gorilla</b>, inspired by a childhood memory.</p><p>"When I was little, the highlight of the summer was running barefoot through the grass, in the dark, screaming. We played kick-the-can, and three-times-around-the-house, and sometimes we just stood staring into other people's picture windows, wondering what it would be like to go home to someone else's house."</p><p>That story, however, was only nineteen pages long, and everyone agreed that the ending was a dud. Two years and ten endings later, <b>Good Night, Gorilla</b> was published and recognized as an ALA Notable Children's Book for 1994.</p><p>The recipient of the 1996 Caldecott Medal, <b>Officer Buckle and Gloria</b>, is the story of a school safety officer upstaged by his canine partner.</p><p>"We have a videotape of my mother chatting in the dining room while, unnoticed by her or the cameraman, the dog is licking every poached egg on the buffet. The next scene shows the whole family at the breakfast table, complimenting my mother on the delicious poached eggs. The dog, of course, is pretending not to know what a poached egg is. The first time we watched that tape we were so shocked, we couldn't stop laughing. I suspect that videotape had a big influence on my choice of subject matter."</p><p>Ms. Rathmann lives and works in San Francisco, in an apartment she shares with her husband, John Wick, and a very funny bunch of ants.</p><p>copyright � 2000 by Penguin Putnam Books for Young Readers.

Here, with uncommon sensitivity and support, he invites us to explore grief not as a process of recovery, but as the ongoing narrative of our relationship with the one we&#x2019;ve lost&#x2015;to be fully felt, told, and woven into our lives.</p><p> For those in bereavement and anyone supporting those who are, <i>Getting Grief Right</i> offers an uncommonly empathetic guide to opening to our sorrow as the full expression of our love.</p></p><p><p><b>PhD Patrick O&#x2019;Malley</b><br><b>Patrick O'Malley, PHD</b>, has been providing grief counseling and education to clients and colleagues for over 35 years.

Getting Grief Right is not a list of stages or rules. It does not pretend to know about the grief of others. Because O&#x2019;Malley, a psychotherapist, himself suffered the inconsolable loss of the death of his child, he can accompany others through their grieving. His book becomes a warm, accepting presence, telling stories and inviting readers to tell their own. Grieving does not end, O&#x2019;Malley softly notes, but the stories that we tell about those we have lost turn the grief right back into the love from which it springs.&#x201d; &#x2015;Rita Charon, MD, PhD, professor of medicine at Columbia University Medical Center; executive director, Program in Narrative Medicine</p><p>&#x201c;In Getting Grief Right, O&#x2019;Malley dispels the myth that we&#x2019;ll get over a death, achieve closure, and move on with our lives grief-free. O&#x2019;Malley validates my experience of ministering for forty-five years to grieving people: they want to, they need to, talk about and remember their loved ones who died. He helps us understand what is unique about each person&#x2019;s grief story, and how our grief story is our &#x2018;therapy.&#x201d; &#x2015;Fr. Charles Calabrese, chaplain, Texas Health Harris Methodist Hospital Fort Worth</p><p>&#x201c;Getting Grief Right should be required reading for all those entering the counseling profession, as well as those of us who mourn the death of a loved one. Dr. Patrick O'Malley is a very wise, compassionate storyteller. He gives us reassurance and permission to embrace our own grief journey by removing the fear that we are not grieving correctly. He helps us understand that to mourn and grieve is as natural as breathing. We ask, &#x2018;How long will it take?&#x2019; Dr. O'Malley says, &#x2018;How deeply did you love?&#x2019; This book is a masterpiece that will touch your heart and soul with healing powers.&#x201d; &#x2015;Peggy Bohme, cofounder of The WARM Place Grief Support Center for Children in Fort Worth, Texas</p><p>&#x201c;Patrick O&#x2019;Malley is a rare and refreshing voice in the world of grief literacy.

Different kinds of loss bring different stories, and different kinds of pain. Telling the story of how you loved and how you lost gives shape and meaning to what first seems to be a meaningless, uncontrollable event.&#x201d; &#x2015;The New York Times Book Review</p><p>&#x201c;There is no right way to navigate the mysterious and holy landscape of grief. And there is no wrong way. With profound compassion and juicy storytelling, Patrick O&#x2019;Malley offers those of us whose lives have been shattered by loss permission to mourn our loved ones with all our hearts and find our own transformational stories in the crucible of our authentic life experiences.&#x201d; &#x2015;Mirabai Starr, author of Caravan of No Despair: A Memoir of Loss and Transformation; translator of Dark Night of the Soul (St. John of the Cross)</p><p>&#x201c;Getting Grief Right is a compassionate, wise, and practical guide that gives space for our grief to tell its own story and be as it is. A very valuable, up-to-date resource for anyone wanting to consciously navigate this challenging inner landscape.&#x201d; &#x2015;John J. Prendergast, PhD, author of In Touch: How to Tune In to the Inner Guidance of Your Body and Trust Yourself; psychotherapist; adjunct professor of psychology (retired), California Institute of Integral Studies</p><p>&#x201c;Nearly four decades ago, Patrick O&#x2019;Malley and his wife Nancy experienced every parent&#x2019;s nightmare: the death of their infant son. Over the years since, O&#x2019;Malley has allowed his grief to shape not only his heart but also his mind, and in this book he offers profound wisdom about the texture of grief. Avoiding clich�s and shattering the idea that grief marches through some predictable and lock-step set of &#x2018;stages,&#x2019; O&#x2019;Malley instead understands that every experience of grief is personal and unique and that every griever has a story worth telling. This book is immensely valuable, both for those who grieve and for those who want to offer them true consolation.&#x201d; &#x2015;Thomas G. Long, coauthor of The Good Funeral: Death, Grief, and the Community of Care</p><p>&#x201c;Getting Grief Right offers both individual mourners and grief groups a restorative approach to handling grief while preserving memories of our loved ones. Asserting that grief is embedded in the everyday experience of being human, O&#x2019;Malley and Madigan argue for a re-framing of grief as something that mourners recognize and accommodate, rather than a stage to be worked beyond. Through an effective formula based on years of both personal and professional experience, the authors offer a template for the reader&#x2019;s grief journey that works in both private and group settings. I highly recommend the book&#x2019;s study guide for anyone interested in honoring their own grief journey or eager to help others who have recently experienced loss. This book is an ideal companion for grief workshops, and it is sure to become an integral tool in learning to live with loss.&#x201d; &#x2015;Candi Cann, PhD, associate profession of religion at Baylor University and author of Virtual Afterlives: Grieving the Dead in the Twenty-First Century</p><p>&#x201c;With Getting Grief Right, Patrick O&#x2019;Malley touches an issue dear to my heart and mind: the importance of telling the truth about loss, which is really the truth about love.

She clutched the envelope tight and her heart pumped fast as she scurried up the hot cement steps back to her apartment. The air-conditioning was broken, so only scarce puffs of breeze that carried noise and dirt from the traffic wafted through the open windows. It was a tiny apartment in a two-story stucco building near L.A., but it was close to the ocean and the rent was affordable, so Carson had stayed for three years, longer than she&#x2019;d ever lived in any other apartment.<br> <br>Carson carelessly tossed the other mail onto the glass cocktail table, stretched her long limbs out on the nubby brown sofa, then slid her finger along the envelope&#x2019;s seal. Waves of anticipation crested in her bloodstream as she slowly pulled out the navy-trimmed, creamy stationery card. Immediately she caught a whiff of perfume&#x2014;soft sweet spices and orange flowers&#x2014;and, closing her eyes, she saw the Atlantic Ocean, not the Pacific, and the white wooden house on pilings surrounded by palms and ancient oaks. A smile played on her lips. It was so like her grandmother to spray her letters with scent. So old world&#x2014;so Southern.<br> <br>Carson nestled deeper in the cushions and relished each word of the letter. When finished, she looked up and stared in a daze at the motes of dust floating in a shaft of sunlight. The letter was an invitation . . . was it possible?<br> <br>In that moment, Carson could have leaped to her feet and twirled on her toes, sending her long braid flying like that of the little girl in her memories. Mamaw was inviting her to Sullivan&#x2019;s Island. A summer at Sea Breeze. Three whole rent-free months by the sea!<br> <br>Mamaw always had the best timing, she thought, picturing the tall, elegant woman with hair the color of sand and a smile as sultry as a lowcountry sunset. It had been a horrid winter of endings. The television series Carson had been working on had been canceled without warning after a three-year run. Her cash flow was almost gone and she was just trying to figure out how she could make next month&#x2019;s rent. For months she&#x2019;d been bobbing around town looking for work like a piece of driftwood in rough waters.<br> <br>Carson looked again at the letter in her hand. &#x201c;Thank you, Mamaw,&#x201d; she said aloud, feeling it deeply. For the first time in months Carson felt a surge of hope. She paced a circle, her fingers flexing, then strode to the fridge and pulled out a bottle of wine and poured herself a mugful. Next she crossed the room to her small wood desk, pushed the pile of clothing off the chair, then sat down and opened her laptop.<br> <br>To her mind, when you were drowning and a rope was thrown your way, you didn&#x2019;t waste time thinking about what to do. You just grabbed it, then kicked and swam like the devil to safety. She had a lot to do and not much time if she was going to be out of the apartment by the month&#x2019;s end.<br> <br>Carson picked up the invitation again, kissed it, then put her hands on the keys and began typing. She would accept Mamaw&#x2019;s invitation. She was going back to the lowcountry&#x2014;to Mamaw. Back to the only place in the world she&#x2019;d ever thought of as home.<br> <br><br> SUMMERVILLE, SOUTH CAROLINA<p></p> <br>Dora stood at the kitchen stove stirring a red sauce. It was 5:35 P.M. and the rambling Victorian house felt empty and desolate. She used to be able to set a clock by her husband&#x2019;s schedule. Even now, six months after Calhoun had left, Dora expected him to walk through the door carrying the mail. She&#x2019;d lift her cheek toward the man who had been her husband for fourteen years to receive his perfunctory kiss.<br> <br>Dora&#x2019;s attention was caught by the sound of pounding footfalls on the stairs. A moment later, her son burst into the room.<br> <br>&#x201c;I made it to the next level,&#x201d; he announced. He wasn&#x2019;t smiling, but his eyes sparkled with triumph.<br> <br>Dora smiled into his face. Her nine-year-old son made up her world. A big task for such a small boy. Nate was slight and pale, with furtive eyes that always made her wonder why her little boy was afraid. Of what? she&#x2019;d asked his child psychiatrist, who had smiled kindly. &#x201c;Nate isn&#x2019;t so much afraid as he is guarded,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d answered reassuringly. &#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t take it personally, Mrs. Tupper.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nate had never been a cuddly baby, but she worried when his smiling stopped after a year. By two, he didn&#x2019;t establish eye contact or turn his head when called. By three, he no longer came to her for comfort when he was hurt, nor did he notice or care if she cried or got angry. Except if she yelled. Then Nate covered his ears and commenced rocking in a panic.<br> <br>Her every instinct had screamed that something was wrong with her baby and she began furtively reading books on child development. How many times had she turned to Cal with her worries that Nate&#x2019;s speech development was behind the norm and that his movements were clumsy? And how many times had Cal turned on her, adamant that the boy was fine and she was making it all up in her head? She&#x2019;d been like a turtle tucking her head in, afraid to go against him. Already the subject of Nate&#x2019;s development was driving a wedge between them. When Nate turned four, however, and began flapping his hands and making odd noises, she made her first, long-overdue appointment with a child psychiatrist. It was then that the doctor revealed what Dora had long feared: her son had high-functioning autism.<br> <br>Cal received the diagnosis as a psychological death sentence. But Dora was surprised to feel relieved. Having an official diagnosis was better than making up excuses and coping with her suspicions. At least now she could actively help her son.<br> <br>And she did. Dora threw herself into the world of autism spectrum disorders. There was no point in gnashing her teeth wishing that she&#x2019;d followed up on her own instincts sooner, knowing now that early diagnosis and treatment could have meant important strides in Nate&#x2019;s development. Instead, she focused her energy on a support group and worked tirelessly to develop an intensive in-home therapy program. It wasn&#x2019;t long before her entire life revolved around Nate and his needs. All her plans for restoring her house fell by the wayside, as did hair appointments, lunches with friends, her size-eight clothes.<br> <br>And her marriage.<br> <br>Dora had been devastated when Cal announced seemingly out of the blue one Saturday afternoon in October that he couldn&#x2019;t handle living with her and Nate any longer. He assured her she would be taken care of, packed a bag, and walked out of the house. And that was that.<br> <br>Dora quickly turned off the stove and wiped her hands on her apron. She put on a bright smile to greet her son, fighting her instinct to lean over and kiss him as he entered the room. Nate didn&#x2019;t like being touched. She reached over to the counter to retrieve the navy-trimmed invitation that had arrived in the morning&#x2019;s mail.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a surprise for you,&#x201d; she told him with a lilt in her voice, feeling that the time was right to share Mamaw&#x2019;s summer plans.<br> <br>Nate tilted his head, mildly curious but uncertain. &#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> <br>She opened the envelope and pulled out the card, catching the scent of her grandmother&#x2019;s perfume. Smiling with anticipation, Dora quickly read the letter aloud. When Nate didn&#x2019;t respond, she said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s an invitation. Mamaw is having a party for her eightieth birthday.&#x201d;<br> <br>He immediately shrank inward. &#x201c;Do I have to go?&#x201d; he asked, his brow furrowed with worry.<br> <br>Dora understood that Nate didn&#x2019;t like to attend social gatherings, not even for people he loved, like his great-grandmother. Dora bent closer and smiled. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just to Mamaw&#x2019;s house. You love going to Sea Breeze.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nate turned his head to look out the window, avoiding her eyes as he spoke. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like parties.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nor was he ever invited to any, she thought sadly. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not really a party,&#x201d; Dora hastened to explain, careful to keep her voice upbeat but calm. She didn&#x2019;t want Nate to set his mind against it. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s only family coming&#x2014;you and me and your two aunts. We&#x2019;re invited to go to Sea Breeze for the weekend.&#x201d; A short laugh of incredulousness burst from her throat. &#x201c;For the summer, actually.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nate screwed up his face. &#x201c;For the summer?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nate, we always go to Sea Breeze to see Mamaw in July, remember? We&#x2019;re just going a little earlier this year because it is Mamaw&#x2019;s birthday. She will be eighty years old. It&#x2019;s a very special birthday for her.&#x201d; She hoped she&#x2019;d explained it clearly enough for him to work it out. Nate was extremely uncomfortable with change. He liked everything in his life to be in order. Especially now that his daddy had left.<br> <br>The past six months had been rocky for both of them. Though there had never been much interaction between Nate and his father, Nate had been extremely agitated for weeks after Cal moved out. He&#x2019;d wanted to know if his father was ill and had gone to the hospital. Or was he traveling on business like some of his classmates&#x2019; fathers? When Dora made it clear that his father was not ever returning to the house to live with them, Nate had narrowed his eyes and asked her if Cal was, in fact, dead. Dora had looked at Nate&#x2019;s taciturn face, and it was unsettling to realize that he wasn&#x2019;t upset at the possibility his father might be dead. He merely needed to know for certain whether Calhoun Tupper was alive or dead so that all was in order in his life. She had to admit that it made the prospect of a divorce less painful.<br> <br>&#x201c;If I go to Mamaw&#x2019;s house I will need to take my tetra,&#x201d; Nate told her at length. &#x201c;The fish will die if I leave it alone in the house.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dora slowly released her breath at the concession. &#x201c;Yes, that&#x2019;s a very good idea,&#x201d; she told him cheerfully. Then, because she didn&#x2019;t want him to dwell and because it had been a good day for Nate so far, she moved on to a topic that he wouldn&#x2019;t find threatening. &#x201c;Now, suppose you tell me about the new level of your game. What is your next challenge?&#x201d;<br> <br>Nate considered this question, then tilted his head and began to explain in tedious detail the challenges he faced in the game and how he planned to meet them.<br> <br>Dora returned to the stove, careful to mutter, &#x201c;Uh-huh,&#x201d; from time to time as Nate prattled on. Her sauce had gone cold and all the giddiness that she&#x2019;d experienced when reading the invitation fizzled in her chest, leaving her feeling flat. Mamaw had been clear that this was to be a girls-only weekend. Oh, Dora would have loved a weekend away from the countless monotonous chores for a few days of wine and laughter, of catching up with her sisters, of being a Summer Girl again. Only a few days . . . Was that too much to ask?<br> <br>Apparently, it was. She&#x2019;d called Cal soon after the invitation had arrived.<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Cal&#x2019;s voice rang in the receiver. &#x201c;You want me to babysit? All weekend?&#x201d;<br> <br>Dora could feel her muscles tighten. &#x201c;It will be fun. You never see Nate anymore.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, it won&#x2019;t be fun. You know how Nate gets when you leave. He won&#x2019;t accept me as your substitute. He never does.&#x201d;<br> <br>She could hear in his voice that he was closing doors. &#x201c;For pity&#x2019;s sake, Cal. You&#x2019;re his father. You have to figure it out!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Be reasonable, Dora. We both know Nate will never tolerate me or a babysitter. He gets very upset when you leave.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tears began to well in her eyes. &#x201c;But I can&#x2019;t bring him. It&#x2019;s a girls-only weekend.&#x201d; Dora lifted the invitation. &#x201c;It says, &#x2018;This invitation does not include husbands, beaus, or mothers.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br> <br>Cal snorted. &#x201c;Typical of your grandmother.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Cal, please . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see what the problem is,&#x201d; he argued, exasperation creeping into his voice. &#x201c;You always bring Nate along with you when you go to Sea Breeze. He knows the house, Mamaw . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But she said&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Frankly, I don&#x2019;t care what she said,&#x201d; Cal said, cutting her off. There was a pause, then he said with a coolness of tone she recognized as finality, &#x201c;If you want to go to Mamaw&#x2019;s, you&#x2019;ll have to bring Nate. That&#x2019;s all there is to it. Now good-bye.&#x201d;<br> <br>It had always been this way with Cal. He never sought to see all of Nate&#x2019;s positive qualities&#x2014;his humor, intelligence, diligence. Rather, Cal had resented the time she spent with their son and complained that their lives revolved around Nate and Nate alone. So, like an intractable child himself, Cal had left them both.<br> <br>Dora&#x2019;s shoulders slumped as she affixed Mamaw&#x2019;s invitation to the refrigerator door with a magnet beside the grocery list and a school photo of her son. In it, Nate was scowling and his large eyes stared at the camera warily. Dora sighed, kissed the photo, and returned to cooking their dinner.<br> <br>While she chopped onions, tears filled her eyes.<br> <br><br> NEW YORK CITY<p></p> <br>Harper Muir-James picked at the piece of toast like a bird. If she nibbled small pieces and chewed each one thoroughly, then sipped water between bites, she found she ate less. As she chewed, Harper&#x2019;s mind was working through the onslaught of emotions that had been roiling since she opened the invitation in the morning&#x2019;s mail. Harper held the invitation between her fingers and looked at the familiar blue-inked script.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mamaw,&#x201d; she whispered, the name feeling foreign on her lips. It had been so long since she&#x2019;d uttered the name aloud.<br> <br>She propped the thick card up against the crystal vase of flowers on the marble breakfast table. Her mother insisted that all the rooms of their prewar condo overlooking Central Park always have fresh flowers. Georgiana had grown up at her family estate in England, where this had been de rigueur. Harper&#x2019;s gaze lazily shifted from the invitation to the park outside her window. Spring had come to Central Park, changing the stark browns and grays of winter to an explosion of spring green. In her mind&#x2019;s eye, however, the scene shifted to the greening cordgrass in the wetlands of the lowcountry, the snaking creeks dotted with docks, and the large, waxy white magnolia blooms against glossy green leaves.<br> <br>Her feelings for her Southern grandmother were like the waterway that raced behind Sea Breeze&#x2014;deep, and swelling with happy memories. In the invitation Mamaw had referred to her &#x201c;Summer Girls.&#x201d; That was a term Harper hadn&#x2019;t heard&#x2014;had not even thought about&#x2014;in over a decade. She hadn&#x2019;t been but twelve years old when she spent her last summer at Sea Breeze. How many times had she seen Mamaw in all those years? It surprised Harper to realize it had been only three times.<br> <br>There had been so many invitations sent to her in those intervening years. So many regrets returned. Harper felt a twinge of shame as she pondered how she could have let so many years pass without paying Mamaw a visit.<br> <br>&#x201c;Harper? Where are you?&#x201d; a voice called from the hall.<br> <br>Harper coughed on a crumb of dry toast.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ah, there you are,&#x201d; her mother said, walking into the kitchen.<br> <br>Georgiana James never merely entered a room; she arrived. There was a rustle of fabric and an aura of sparks of energy radiating around her. Not to mention her perfume, which was like the blare of trumpets entering the room before her.

In the summer of 1869, Muir set out from California&#x2019;s Central Valley with a flock of 2,050 sheep and made his way to the headwaters of the Merced and Tuolumne Rivers. As one of America&#x2019;s great philosopher naturalists, Muir captures the spirit of the Sierra Nevada and brings the reader along as a witness to his great journey. He explores in great detail the mountains, meadows, waterfalls, flora, and fauna of the rich landscape that captured his heart. My First Summer in the Sierra is an excellent introduction to the writings of John Muir. This edition contains 30 illustrations."Oh, these vast, calm, measureless mountain days, inciting at once to work and rest ! Days in whose light everything seems equally divine, opening a thousand windows to show us God. Nevermore, however weary, should one faint by the way who gains the blessings of one mountain day ; whatever his fate, long life, short life, stormy or calm, he is rich forever."</p><p><p>From the photographer who brought Thoreau's<em> Walden</em> and<em> Cape Cod </em>to life comes a new work combining classic literature with brand-new photography. This time, Scot Miller takes on the seminal work of John Muir, <em>My First Summer in the Sierra.</em> The book details Muir's first extended trip to the Sierra Nevada in what is now Yosemite National Park, a landscape that entranced him immediately and had a profound effect on his life. The towering waterfalls, natural rock formations, and abundant plant and animal life helped Muir develop his views of the natural world, views that would eventually lead him to push for the creation of the national parks.</p> <p>Timed to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the book's original publication by Houghton Mifflin Company,<em> My First Summer in the Sierra</em> is illustrated with Miller's stunning photographs, showcasing the dramatic landscape of the High Sierra plus John Muir's illustrations from the original edition and several previously unpublished illustrations from his 1911 manuscript. The publication of <em>My First Summer in the Sierra </em>inspired many to journey there, and this newly illustrated anniversary edition will surely inspire many more.</p> <p>This book is being published in collaboration with Yosemite Conservancy and, for each copy sold, Scot Miller is making a donation to Yosemite Conservancy.<br></p> <p> <strong>A Look Inside <i>My First Summer in the Sierra</i> </strong><br><b> (Click on Images to Enlarge)</b> <br> </p> <p></p><p></p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> Sunset ceremony </td> <td> Summer shower Tuolumne Meadows</td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td><td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> Cathedral Peak after the storm</td> <td> Nevada Fall and Liberty Cap </td> </tr> </tbody></table>&#x201c;Writing, Muir once said, is 'like the life of a glacier, one eternal grind.'&nbsp; My First Summer in the Sierra, his best and most enduring book, extends the analogy.&nbsp; Just as the unforgettable granite domes of Yosemite, so impressive, impassive and seemingly impermeable, were molded and shaped by patient glaciation, each journal entry here has been sculpted and polished by the man who considered glaciers proof of 'Nature as a poet, an enthusiastic workingman.'<br>'Everything in Nature called destruction must be creation, a change from beauty to beauty,' Muir advises us in these pages, distilling what he learned during his life-changing three and a half months in the Sierra.&nbsp;<br>In the mountains he called the 'Range of Light,' such insights come more easily, he said, because&nbsp;<br>'everything is perfectly clean and pure and full of divine lessons . . . until the hand of God becomes visible.'&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>from the foreword by <br>Dayton Duncan and Ken Burns&nbsp; <br></p><h2>It&#39;s Not Your Fault, Koko Bear: A Read-Together Book for Parents and Young Children During Divorce (Lansky, Vicki)</h2><p>This easy-to-understand children&#39;s story and parenting guide is intended for families where both parents plan to stay active and involved in their child&#39;s life. &#34;It&#39;s Not Your Fault, KoKo Bear&#34; revolves around a lovable bear who doesn&#39;t want to have two homes.

Here's a children's book and parenting tool rolled into one. <i>It's Not Your Fault, Koko Bear</i> is a picture book designed to be read by parents to their children. Koko Bear's parents are getting a divorce, and Koko, a preschool-aged unisex bear, isn't happy about it. "I don't like this divorce. I don't want two homes," Koko says. Koko Bear's story doesn't minimize kids' pain, but it doesn't wallow in it either. The message is positive: children are reassured that their feelings are natural, that their parents still love and will care for them, and that the divorce is not their fault. At the bottom of each page, there are bullet points for parents that give information and advice about what the kids are going through, and the best way to handle each issue as it arises. <i>(Ages 3 to 7 and parents)</i>PreSchool-Grade 2AKoKo Bear's parents are getting divorced, and the cub must go through many adjustments and deal with a wide range of emotions: anger, guilt, confusion, and sadness. At every step, MaMa and PaPa are helpful, understanding, and supportive. In fact, Lansky's introduction for parents notes that adults might think they "are unrealistically polite and even-tempered." However, this is a book with a purpose, and as such, plot and character take a backseat to message. Below each block of text are comments and suggestions for adults to deal with issues raised by that section of the story. The illustrations are similarly low-key and pleasant, adding to the overall sense of well being. As bibliotherapy, this book serves a purpose. It might be shelved with the author's Divorce Book for Parents (Book Peddlers, 1991) as well as in the juvenile section.AKathy Piehl, Mankato State University, MN<br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Snurtch</h2><p>Some days are Snurtch days.

Children whose cheeks flush with quick anger and whose school days are riddled with frustration and regret will empathize deeply with Ruthie's helplessness at the hands of her Snurtch.... While the Snurtch doesn't appear scary (it looks kind of silly), its perfect embodiment of overwhelming (and instantly regrettable) impulses borders on heart-wrenching. Every student harbors and battles a Snurtch, as readers see with relief on the final pages of this clever, pertinent book, but some have bigger, more monstrous ones than others. Ruthie's dark brow, set mouth, and hooded eyes make clear the weighty burden she carries around like a backpack. Original in its visual and linguistic presentation of behavioral problems, this important call for understanding should sit on library, classroom, and bedroom&nbsp;shelves&#x2014;the high ones, just above a Snurtch's reach."

The Snurtch isn&#x2019;t vanquished (nobody&#x2019;s perfect), but with Ruthie&#x2019;s new sense of self, it becomes a little more empathic, which vastly improves her feelings toward school. It&#x2019;s beautifully true to life, and Santoso&#x2019;s quick-tempered heroine, with her eloquent grimaces and pigtails that festoon her head like architectural detailing, is fully deserving of readers&#x2019; sympathies.

With more than thirty years in recovery from drug addiction, she&#x2019;s been crafting this novel for years."Raw, honest, fascinating insight into the growing-up years of a girl raised by what might be an ordinary family with ordinary flaws, and the extraordinary effects their lives have on her.

A. Wright's book is a compelling illustration of what fertile ground families are for nurturing addiction. It's not all doom and&nbsp;gloom&nbsp;however - the story is told in a clear-eyed, unsentimental voice which, for me, made it utterly convincing. It's captivating, heartrending and uplifting."<br><b>- Morrin Rout,</b>&nbsp;Former Literary Director of Chch Writers' Festival, Director of Hagley Writers' Institute<br><br>Portland Book Review - Feb 2016The review for How to Grow an Addict received 5 stars.<br><br>"J.A. Wright's How to Grow an Addict&nbsp;is a novelization about Randall, a young girl who is trying to navigate the testy waters of her family life and come out unscathed despite growing up in a house full of addicts and abusers. It reads like a memoir, a sort of "come clean" string of consciousness that chronicles her rise (or rather, fall) from a young girl to a young woman.<br>The novel is literally what the title implies, a sort of explanation of a series of factors both genetic and environmental that lead to the rise of a small, precocious, and anxious child becoming a full blown addict. Randall has an abusive father and a mother who has a hard time defending her as it is clear that she's terrified of losing him (going so far as to get breast implants in a failed attempt to stop him from sleeping around). He behaves like he hates Randall, and she chews her fingernails to nubs as a result - and has a hard time functioning in a normal world without fidgeting.<br>Randall is immensely likable, and though the reader begins to see her make a series of missteps as she gets older in an attempt to seek out love in "all the wrong places," the novel never takes on a judgmental tone. Randall is just a girl who's trying to navigate a very difficult situation that gets increasingly more difficult as life takes away some of her fiercest protectors and supporters. She is selfish, but only in a way that an addict is - someone who cannot see past their impulsive decisions into what the consequences may mean. It doesn't matter to her as she's just trying to get by in the only way she knows how. Her family resembles a million families, and some readers might even see some parallels between her family and their own in an alcoholic, abusive father who prioritizes a son above a daughter and creates another monster in the process; her brother who comes to hate her and lack empathy as much as her father does; her mother who is not perfect, but sad and unable to manage an angry and abusive husband, and who turns to anti-anxiety pills and alcohol as a way to cope.<br>The novel ends with Randall beginning to accept help from those who have to foist it onto her and ends with an uplifting message: people can make a choice to recover and do the right thing. There may be mistakes and trip-ups in the process, but it's a process worth doing. This is a great book, and even if readers don't have first-hand experience with addicts or dysfunctional families, Randall feels real-life enough to turn to when it comes to trying to deal with real-life addiction. Readers should definitely give this one a shot."- <i>Portland Book Review</i><br><br>How To Grow An Addict&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Brilliant and an unstoppable read. This novel takes us right to the roots of a young addict's mind and vividly through the sights, sounds and smells of growing up. Wright radiates veracity from the tiniest of incidental details to the greatest of comic and tragic catastrophes. Part Charles Dickens part Charlie Brown. It is, in turn, thrilling and heart- breaking. She also pulls off the difficult trick of making one identify with the simple humanity of the main character, whether or not one has anything in common with her. Wright is never judgmental. It feels so intimate and honest that I felt privileged and humble at being confided in with Randall's story. Beautifully woven, beautifully told and deeply enthralling; as soon as I had finished the book I wanted another one . . . hmm, should I be worried? Not in this case.

In the past decade, neuroscientific research has greatly advanced our understanding of the brain mechanisms of addiction. However this information still remains largely confined to scientific outlets. As legislation continues to evolve and the stigma surrounding addiction persists, new findings on the impact of substances on the brain are an important public health issue. Francesca Mapua Filbey gives readers an overview of research on addiction including classic theories as well as current neuroscientific studies. A variety of textual supports - including a glossary, learning objectives and review questions - help students better reinforce their reading and make the text a ready-made complement to undergraduate and graduate courses on addiction.</p><p>This book answers a growing need for accessible information on the neuroscience of addiction among both students and the public. Targeted at undergraduates, post-graduates and informed laypeople, it is a ready-made textbook for courses on addiction.Francesca Mapua Filbey is a Professor of Cognition and Neuroscience, and Bert Moore Endowed Chair of BrainHealth(TM), for the School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences at the University of Texas, Dallas. She conducts research aimed to understand the biobehavioral mechanisms of addictive disorders towards the improvement of early detection and intervention.</p><h2>Road to Reading: A Program for Preventing and Remediating Reading Difficulties</h2><p><p>It's here!

Blachman, Ph.D., &amp; Darlene Tangel, Ph.D.</p><p>Copyright � 2008 by Paul H. Brookes Publishing Co. All rights reserved. No part of this excerpt may be reproduced or reprinted without permission in writing from the publisher. </p><br><br><p>Two consensus panels (Snow et al., 1998; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [NICHD], 2000) provided a much needed blueprint for early reading practices proven to reduce the number of students who experience diffi culty learning to read. The practices include, among others, instruction in phonological awareness, the alphabetic principle, and accurate and fluent word recognition, as well as frequent opportunities for text-based reading with corrective feedback to build motivation and comprehension strategies.</p><p><i>Road to Reading</i> embraces these practices and provides a framework for providing both early intervention to prevent reading difficulties and remedial instruction for students who are struggling to learn to read</p><p><b>Goals of the Program</b></p><p>An important objective of this program is to help develop accurate and fluent word identification. The emphasis is on explicit, systematic, <b>research&#x2013;based</b> instruction to help students understand the alphabetic principle (i.e., how individual letters and letter combinations represent spoken language sounds). The word recognition skills introduced provide the essential foundation and support for good reading comprehension.</p><p>Accurate and fluent word identification can be developed, in part, by learning the six basic syllable patterns. This program provides an overview of the structure of the English language by introducing the six syllable patterns and the most common phonetic elements. The six syllable patterns include the following:<br></p><ul><li>Closed syllables (as in <i>h<b>a</b>t</i> and <i>fl<b>a</b>g</i>)</li><br><br><li>Final "e" syllables (as in <i>l<b>a</b>k<b>e</b></i> and <i>sl<b>i</b>d<b>e</b></i>)</li><br><br><li>Open syllables (as in <i><b>he</b></i> and the first syllable of <i><b>si</b>lent</i>)</li><br><br><li>Vowel team syllables (as in <i> tr<b>ai</b>n</i>, <i> l<b>ea</b>f</i>, and <i> cl<b>ow</b>n</i>)</li><br><br><li>Vowel + r syllables (as in <i> c<b>ar</b>, h<b>or</b>n</i>, and <i> p<b>er</b>ch</i>)</li><br><br><li>Consonant + <i> le</i> (as in <i> sim<b>ple</b></i> and <i> tum<b>ble</b></i>)</li></ul><p>All of the syllable patterns will be learned as the students progress through the six levels of the program. These patterns will be practiced by the students when they read decodable texts and also reinforced as they read a wide variety of trade books and books representing various genres</p><p>The goal in teaching these patterns is for students to begin to read appropriate grade level texts fluently and with good comprehension as early as possible.</p><p><b>Is This a Complete Reading Program?</b></p><p>Although this is not a complete <i> classroom</i> reading program, it can be used in conjunction with any reading series. For example, although the program includes specifi c high frequency words (Fry &amp; Kress, 2006), one could substitute high frequency words from any basal series or list. In addition, decodable books from any series can be substituted for the decodable books on our book charts. Likewise, basal anthologies and leveled books could be substituted for the trade books on our trade book list.</p><p>We have woven vocabulary throughout this program by highlighting words and encouraging teachers to use daily opportunities to extend vocabulary. We do not, however, include specific instructions for teaching vocabulary. Because teachers will be selecting books from various sources, choices about which vocabulary words to teach should be based on the needs of the students and the books the students are reading.</p><p>The program includes frequent opportunities to read and reread both narrative and expository text with corrective feedback to develop fluency, build comprehension strategies, and foster reading for information and pleasure. Although we encourage teachers to help students self&#x2013;monitor text for understanding and to focus students' attention on meaning of text from their earliest reading experiences, we do not provide directions for the teacher regarding how to teach comprehension strategies. (For more specific information on how to provide early comprehension instruction, see, e.g., NICHD, 2000; Snow et al., 1998; and Stahl, 2004.)</p><p><b>Who Is This Program For?</b></p><p>This five&#x2013;step research&#x2013; based program has been used with groups of varying sizes in a variety of settings, such as general education classrooms, remedial reading programs, resource rooms, and one&#x2013;to&#x2013;one tutoring. If you are using this program during the English language arts block, the lessons should take about 30&#x2013;40 minutes. We recommend that the group size not exceed six students.</p><p>This program has also been used with small groups of three to six students and with individual students (one&#x2013;to&#x2013;one) who are not meeting grade level benchmarks in their classroom reading program or on statewide assessments. These students have been taught by general education teachers, reading teachers, and special education teachers both in and out of the general classroom setting. In a recently reported tutoring study using this program (Blachman et al., 2004), lessons were expanded to 50 minutes to provide more sustained and intensive instruction for second&#x2013;and third&#x2013;grade struggling readers. This program can also be adapted for use with older students by adding more multisyllabic words at each level and by including age&#x2013;appropriate trade books.</p><p>This program has proven to be flexible in a variety of settings and will allow the teacher to provide <b><i>scientifically&#x2013;based</i></b> reading instruction to all students.</p><p><b>Pacing</b></p><p>A critical factor in the success of a young child learning to read is proper pacing of instruction. There are many pacing decisions (e.g., how many times a word needs to be reviewed, how many times a book needs to be reread to develop fluency) that only you will be able to make as you get to know your students. Teachers have often asked how long it takes to complete this program. There is not one right answer to this question. The speed with which students complete the program will depend on their initial skill level, their rate of learning, and whether this program is being used for early intervention with students in first grade in a general education classroom or as a remedial program with somewhat older students (Grades 2&#x2013;4) who have already experienced difficulty learning to read.</p><p>As you use this program, you will become more skilled at knowing when your students are ready to move on and when they need more practice. If you have questions about your students' readiness to move on, adjust your lesson plan for the next day and include some of the more challenging material as a diagnostic tool to help you make your decision.</p><p><b>Progress Monitoring</b></p><p>Regular progress monitoring is a critically important component of instruction. The notes that you make on your daily lesson plans, as well as the more formal assessments used by your district, will help you evaluate the success of each student in your group on an ongoing basis. To help you get started with progress monitoring, we have created a brief assessment for each level. These assessments can be found on the accompanying CD&#x2013;ROM .</p><p><b>Getting Ready to Use the Program</b></p><p><b>The Six Levels</b></p><p>The best way to get started is to <i><b>familiarize yourself with the six levels</b></i> of the program. Each level includes the following: A list of goals for that level Text that will guide your teaching Additional materials to help you plan your daily lessons </p><p>You will see that each of the six levels is color coded using the colors of the rainbow:<b> red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple</b> (we cheated a bit and collapsed indigo and violet&#x2014;the last two colors in the "proper" rainbow&#x2014;into purple).</p><p>Each level, starting with Red, increases in difficulty and builds on the previous level. In the Red Level, students begin the program by reviewing consonants, learning short vowels, and learning the first set of high frequency words.</p><p><b>The Five&#x2013;Step Plan</b></p> The daily lesson for each level includes five steps. As students move through each level of the program, the Five&#x2013;Step Plan remains the same. <b><i>That is, the content of each daily lesson increases in difficulty, but the five steps used to teach the content will always be the same.</i></b><p></p><ol><b></b><li><b> Review sound-symbol correspondences</b> Review sound-symbol associations and introduce new sounds. <b></b></li><li><b> Teach or review new decoding skill</b> Practice making words to develop a new decoding skill (e.g., building words with the final "e" pattern), reinforcing both phonemic awareness and phonics skills. <b></b></li><li><b>Review phonetically regular words (PRWs) and high frequency words (HFWs)</b> Review previously learned phonetically regular words and high frequency words, with an emphasis on fl uency and opportunities to extend vocabulary. <b></b></li><li><b>Read orally in context</b> Read orally narrative and expository text for fluency and comprehension. <b></b></li><li><b>Dictation</b> Spell words from earlier steps in the lesson. </li></ol><b></b><p><b>Lesson Plans and Materials</b> Before you teach each lesson, you will need to prepare your <i>lesson plan</i> and gather the materials needed to teach each of the five steps. <b></b></p><p><b>Lesson Plan</b> A blank lesson plan form (see sample provided) can be printed from the CD&#x2013;ROM . The lesson plan is set up according to the five steps of the lesson. Each step on the plan has spaces for you to write exactly which letter sounds, words, sentences, and books you will be using in each lesson. Appendix A contains three sample lesson plans for each of the six levels. Each level of the program also includes lists and charts to assist you in preparing your lessons.</p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>Shabbat Is Coming!</h2><p><p><em>Friday&#x2019;s here. <br> Jump and cheer. <br> Shabbat is coming. <br> </em><br> A family and its pet puppy eagerly prepare for Shabbat.</p></p><p><p><strong>Tracy Newman</strong>'s<strong> </strong>writing inspiration comes from her adventures raising her children.

The story of Joe (Jonah to Mom) opens with Joe's first day at a new school, and threats from the class bully if he doesn't do his homework for him. Mom is unmarried and has moved to a dilapidated old house left to her by Joe's Great-Grandma. A debt collector arrives on the doorstep; Great-Grandma had failed to pay her tax, and jobless Mom doesn't have enough money.

Bullying is one of the themes that is so masterfully developed and it's a common reality in modern schools. The characters are compelling and memorable. The narrative voice is absorbing. I read this book with my seven-year-old son and he developed a lot of sympathy for Joe. I was thrilled when he asked questions, just the way he does whenever I read The Little Prince by Antoine de St-Exup�ry to him.

That was before the harsh-ruling Governor arrived, and ravens drove out the native birds. Now there are no songbirds, and the people are forbidden to travel beyond the forest that separates them from the rest of the island. <br> But for Isabella, the legends of her island home have always seemed like more than just stories.

All the smaller birds flew backward into the sea, and that is why there are no songbirds on Joya. Only huge, ragged ravens. I&#x2019;d watch them perch on the rooftops like omens, and try to squint them into the chaffinches and goldcrests Da drew from memory. If I imagined hard enough, I could almost hear them singing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Why did the songbirds leave, Da?&#x201d; I&#x2019;d ask.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Because they could, Isabella.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;And the wolves?

But I kept asking, until the day came when I found my own answers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The morning it began was like any other.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I woke in my narrow bed, sunrise just starting to brighten the mud walls of my room. The smell of burnt porridge hung on the air. Da must have been up for hours, as it took a long time for the fire to heat the heavy clay pot. I could hear Miss La, our hen, scratching about outside my room, seeking out crumbs. She was twelve years old, same as me, but even though it&#x2019;s young for a person, it&#x2019;s very, very old for a chicken. Her feathers were gray, her mood was black, and even our cat, Pep, was scared of her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My tummy rumbled as I stretched out my arms. Pep was sprawled across my legs, and he yowled loudly as I sat up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You awake, Isabella?&#x201d; Da called from the kitchen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Morning, Da.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Porridge is ready. A little overready, in fact . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Coming!&#x201d; I eased my legs out and smoothed the cat&#x2019;s rough fur where it had ruffled in the night. &#x201c;Sorry, Pep.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He purred and closed his green eyes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I washed my face in the basin by the window and stuck a tongue out at the reflection in the polished metal above Gabo&#x2019;s bed. I straightened his sheets, dustier every day but still made, and traced the voice line arched next to his pillow--a long, thin hollow Da had etched for us up the walls and over the ceiling. When we pressed our lips to it and whispered, it carried our voices so we could talk even when we were at each end of the room in our separate beds.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Three years now. Three years since I sat there, my twin&#x2019;s hand fire in mine as he faded in the night, fast as a blown-out match.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But still I could conjure him. Easy as breathing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It would not do to start the day sad. Shaking the thoughts out of my head, I pulled on my school dress instead. It was as big as it had been six weeks before. My best friend, Lupe, would laugh. Still the shortest in the class! she&#x2019;d say.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I quickly braided my unbrushed hair and hoped Da wouldn&#x2019;t notice I hadn&#x2019;t untangled it all summer. Pep was rolling on the bed, but I wasn&#x2019;t allowed to stroke him with my uniform on. My teacher, Se�ora Feliz, was always picking ginger hairs off my dress with irritated fingers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I pulled aside the curtain that served as my bedroom door and carefully stepped over Miss La, who squawked as I scattered her small pile of crumbs. She narrowed her misty eyes and pecked at my ankles, chasing me farther into the main room, where we ate, talked, and planned adventures.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A big bowl of blackened porridge sat on our large pine-plank table, marooned among a sea of maps. More of Da&#x2019;s maps were stuck to the walls, and they rustled as I passed, like a talking breeze.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I traced the papers with my finger, as I did every morning, watching how the silver pigment of Afrik&#x2019;s rivers met those of �ygpt, how �ygpt clung to the curve of Europa Bay like one hand grasping another across the sea. On the opposite wall hung the sketchy coast of Amrica and its dragging ocean currents, labeled with strange, wondrous names: the Frozen Circle, the Vanishing Triangle, the Cerulean Sea. The paper was dyed a beautiful deep blue, and the currents were picked out in thread against it. Da had used a needle and thread thin as a hair for these: gold for Cerulean, black for the Triangle, white for the Frozen Circle. But past the eastern coast, everything stopped. Only one word broke the blankness:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Incognito. Unknown.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I could almost feel Da&#x2019;s disappointment in the long-dried ink of the word. Unfavorable tides on his last trip had meant an early return to Joya, and Da never again made it across that wild expanse before the Governor arrived on our island. Governor Adori closed the ports and made the forest that stretched coast to coast between our village of Gromera and the rest of the island into a border, banishing anyone who resisted his rule to the other side. Gromera was cut off from the rest of Joya, and the forest was strung with thick thorns and enormous bells to warn the Governor&#x2019;s guards if anyone came through. I had never heard the bells ring.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I knew Da dreamt of filling in the gaps on his Amrica maps, whereas what I wanted, more than anything else, was to cross the forest border and chart the Forgotten Territories, which lay beyond, though I had never told him so.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There was only one map that showed the whole of our island, and it hung in Da&#x2019;s study. I called it Ma&#x2019;s map because it had been passed down through her family for generations, maybe even as far back as Arinta&#x2019;s time a thousand years ago. It had always felt like a sign that Ma and Da were meant for each other, that he was a cartographer and her only heirloom was a map.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Each of us carries the map of our lives on our skin, in the way we walk, even the way we grow, Da would often say. See here how my blood runs not blue at my wrist, but black? Your mother always said it was ink. I am a cartographer through to my heart.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Fetch the jug, would you?&#x201d; Da&#x2019;s voice made me jump, pulling me back into the room.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I dragged a chair to the shelves, carefully taking the jug from high up, and put it on the table next to the porridge. It was forest green and special because it was the last thing Ma had made. We used it only on the first and last days of school, or birthdays and feast days. Da kept it out of reach and washed it with great care.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I could remember Ma sometimes--dark-eyed and mostly smiling, smelling of the black clay she worked with, making pots for the villagers and delicate pieces for the Governor. Or maybe I imagined her, like the songbirds.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Good morning, little one.&#x201d; Da limped from the kitchen. I rushed to take the milk pail and cups he was carrying.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t walk without your stick,&#x201d; I scolded.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Da had broken his leg as a young man, leaping from the jetty of an �ygptian port onto a moving ship that was leaving for Amrica without him, and now used a walking stick carved from a fragment of his great-grandfather&#x2019;s fishing boat. It was my favorite thing out of the many favorite things in the room. Light as paper, it floated in even the thinnest skim of water, but most miraculous of all, it glowed in the dark. Da said it was because of the sap, but I knew it was magic.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I hurried to clear a space on the table, shifting the Himalay Mountains onto a shelf.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Da poured the milk into Ma&#x2019;s jug, then settled down on the bench next to me and grinned. &#x201c;Pick a pocket.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I rolled my eyes. &#x201c;Left.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He wiggled his eyebrows like two black caterpillars. &#x201c;Right answer.&#x201d; He pulled a small jar from his pocket.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Pine honey!&#x201d; I unscrewed the lid, and the smell filled my nostrils, making my mouth water. &#x201c;Thank you, Da.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing but the best for your first day back at school.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I shrugged. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s only school. . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, well, I suppose I&#x2019;ll just have to eat all of this myself, then. . . .&#x201d; He took the open jar and mimed pouring the honey into his mouth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; I grabbed it back. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right, it&#x2019;s a very important day. I&#x2019;m only surprised you didn&#x2019;t get two jars.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The honey was so good I hardly noticed the porridge was burnt, but when I looked up, Da&#x2019;s food was untouched. He was sitting in that hunched way that meant he was thinking. His hand rested on the milk jug, and I could see the pulse in his wrist. His eyes had a faraway look.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>First days of school were hard for both of us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I cleared away my bowl as quietly as I could and pushed his closer to his hand. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see you later, Da.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When he didn&#x2019;t answer, I picked up my satchel and left the house, closing the peeling green door gently behind me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our street ran in a straight, steep line down to the Western Sea, and all the houses were built the same, a long row of mud huts with straw roofs that Lupe thought looked sweet. I thought that they looked as if one good gust of wind would send them all tumbling into the sea.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I normally ran to the market square, skidding downhill on my heels, because the ravens liked to fly low and running put them off. Today, though, I settled into a fast walk--after all, I was almost at the top of the school now. It didn&#x2019;t seem right to run like a little child.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Masha, who lived across the street, was standing in her doorway. I waved, trying to see past her into the house.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Looking for someone?&#x201d; She smiled, her lined face crinkling like old paper. &#x201c;Pablo&#x2019;s already left. You know the Governor likes them to be at work before dawn.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Masha&#x2019;s son, Pablo, had been born when she was already old, her belly swelling even as her hair turned gray and her face creased with age. Masha had called it a miracle, and Pablo was miraculous. Gabo and I had always been in awe of him, as all the villagers were, because of his strength. At age ten, he could lift his parents, one over each shoulder. Having a piggyback from Pablo felt like flying, but it had been a long time since I&#x2019;d seen him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Two years ago, when his mother&#x2019;s back got too bad, Pablo left school and took her place as a laborer, although Masha pleaded with him not to. Now fourteen, he pulled carts as if they were paper, and cared for the Governor&#x2019;s horses too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;He took the present for Lupe,&#x201d; Masha added, wrinkling her nose. I knew she didn&#x2019;t understand why I chose to be friends with the Governor&#x2019;s daughter. &#x201c;I told him to hide it like you asked.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Maybe I&#x2019;ll see him tomorrow?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe.&#x201d; But her voice was not hopeful. He was always up before sunrise, home after dark.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I waved good-bye, shouldered my satchel, and started down the hill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>From this high up, Gromera looked like a wheel, or a starburst, with the market square at its center and streets like spokes spiking outward, some ending at the wide, calm harbor that bottlenecked into the sea, ripe with fish. On a clear night, the stars settled on its surface like water lilies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Governor&#x2019;s ship was moored there, as always. Da said it was carved from a single Afrik baobab trunk. The baobab must be an enormous tree because the hull nearly spanned the width of the port, the mast arrowing toward the sky, the sails stowed. It crouched over the fishing fleet like a mountain, huge and unmoving. Like everything the Governor had, it took up far more space than it ought to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To the east, his house glinted in the sunrise. Built from black basalt and big as five ships, the mansion sat between the blue sea and the green forest, spreading out over the fields like a storm cloud. From here, though, it looked small enough to squash between my forefinger and thumb. Below it was the village, with the school halfway between.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The old school building had been small but bright, and we had painted the walls rainbow colors with whatever dyes Da could spare. But then the Governor had knocked it down--Lupe had decided she&#x2019;d had enough of being taught alone at home and demanded to be sent to the local school like the rest of us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Governor Adori had rebuilt it from stone, twice as big, because if his daughter was going, it had to look grander.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Not for me, you understand,&#x201d; said Lupe with a sad smile. She adopted an even posher voice to add, &#x201c;To uphold the family honor.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We weren&#x2019;t allowed to paint the walls of the new school. A lot of children were unkind to Lupe because of that, but I knew it wasn&#x2019;t her fault.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Behind the Governor&#x2019;s house, closest to the forest, were the orchards, where I had never been. I squinted at the antlike specks of the laborers there and wondered which one was Pablo. To the west, the black sand of the beaches was almost covered by the incoming tide. We were not permitted to be on the beaches at high tide, and no one was allowed in the sea unless they were launching one of the Governor&#x2019;s boats. My toes itched. Da had described being in the sea, but it was not the same as trying it for myself.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Above the beaches were the clay mines, which I tried not to look at because it brought back one of the few clear memories I had of Ma--the day she took Gabo and me to the mines. She taught us how to tie ourselves with vines to a dragon tree--You knot like this, and then rub the sap into your hands for grip--and lowered us one by one into the gorge. Gabo got scared and wriggled so much the knot broke. When he landed on the soft mud at the bottom, it made a very rude noise, and he was filthy when Ma climbed up with him from the darkness.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I laughed so hard it hurt.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I remembered that, that ache in my belly. How it came back two months later, when Ma died. Only then it was sharper, and there was no one carrying anyone out of that darkness. Three years later, the same sweating sickness took Gabo. Three years after that, the clay mine memory still made my throat feel tight.</p></p><h2>Making Magick: Manifesting Your Dreams (40 Affirmation Cards) (Mini Inspiration Cards)</h2><p>Symbols are a universal language, and many are hundreds or even thousands of years old and have been inspiring humankind for generations.

Throughout the Viking age (c. A.D. 800&#x2013;100 ), the vibrancy and aggressive energy of this culture found expression in the bold, often fantastic designs of its art. The royalty-free collection contains over 175 of these designs, adapted from authentic images originating in the metalwork, woodwork, textiles, stone and bone carvings, and ceramics of the Viking homelands of Norway, Denmark, and Sweden, as well as the lands they colonized: Iceland, northern Scotland, the Isle of Man, Ireland, and others. Motifs include sinuously intertwining patterns reminiscent of Celtic art, real and mythological animals, dragon-slaying heroes on horseback, "gripping beasts," and many more, all exuding a sense of power and confidence. Whether you're an artist, illustrator or craftsperson, or simply an admirer of dramatic, eye-catching design, this convenient, inexpensive volume will provide a handy source of inspiration, as well as striking embellishment for a host of graphic projects.</p></p><p></p><h2>Mr. Putter &amp; Tabby Make a Wish</h2><p>Mr. Putter is sure he is too old for birthday celebrations.

St. Charbel&#x2019;s homilies and proverbs are reminiscent of the sayings of the Desert Fathers: simple, homespun, and direct, yet shining and profound. &#x201c;Success in life consists of standing without shame before God.&#x201d; This holy monk speaks from a reservoir of silence about the fundamentals of the Faith and targets the temptations facing all Christians today: the flight from suffering, excessive attachment to comforts, pride over accomplishments, complacency, factiousness, substituting talk for action, fear of proclaiming the truth in an age of hostile unbelief. Alert to the reality of spiritual warfare, St. Charbel calls each one of us to hold fast to the Cross, &#x201c;the center of the universe and the key to heaven,&#x201d; and defy the devil who seeks our ruin. This collection of some of the most beautiful words spoken by St. Charbel is augmented by a short biography that will bring him to the attention of those who have not yet made his acquaintance or profited from his wisdom.</p><p>&#x201c;What a gift is this volume of the writings of St. Charbel Makhlouf! St. Charbel&#x2019;s spiritual counsel is as timely today in our media-saturated, chaotic culture as it was while he lived in the relative simplicity of 19th-century Lebanon.

By the time he could hold a pencil, he knew what his life's work would be. His determination to create books for children led to a BFA from Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York, and an MFA from the California College of Arts &amp; Crafts in Oakland, California.<br><br>It drove him through the years of teaching, designing greeting cards and stage sets, and painting church murals until 1965, when he illustrated his first children's book,<i>Sound</i>, by Lisa Miller for Coward-McCann. Eventually, freed of other obligations, he plunged full time into both writing and illustrating children's books.<br><br>He names Fra Angelico and Giotto, Georges Rouault, and Ben Shahn as major influences on his work, but he soon found his own unique style. His particular way with color, line, detail, and design have earned him many of the most prestigious awards in his field, among them a Caldecott Honor Award for&nbsp;<i>Strega Nona</i>, the Smithsonian Medal from the Smithsonian Institution, the Kerlan Award from the University of Minnesota for his "singular attainment in children's literature," the Catholic Library Association's Regina Medal for his "continued distinguished contribution," and the University of Southern Mississippi Medallion.

All rights reserved.How did panettone , the rich Italian Christmas bread, get its name? With tongue firmly in cheek, dePaola provides this confection as a reply. Chubby Serafina, the baker Antonio's daughter, spends her days eating candy and weeping by the window. For although her father adores her and gives her the best of everything, Tony is convinced there is no man worthy of her. Then Angelo, a wealthy nobleman, falls in love with Serafina and enlists the help of three meddlesome "aunties" to win her father's approval. In return for Serafina's hand in marriage, Angelo sets Tony up in his own bakery in Milano, where he becomes wonderfully rich and famous from sales of an unusually shaped bread: pan di Tonio , or panettone . The tale is a typically charming dePaolian effort, and the illustrations abound with his trademark coziness. Another nice touch: like Tony's currant-filled buns, the story is sprinkled with Italian words and phrases, translations of which are cleverly woven into the text.

He noticed that the rocks he was excavating were arranged in layers; more important, he could see quite clearly that the fossils found in one layer were very different from those found in another. And out of that realization came an epiphany: that by following the fossils, one could trace layers of rocks as they dipped and rose and fell -- clear across England and, indeed, clear across the world. Determined to publish his profoundly important discovery by creating a map that would display the hidden underside of England, he spent twenty years traveling the length and breadth of the kingdom by stagecoach and on foot, studying rock outcrops and fossils, piecing together the image of this unseen universe.</p><p>In 1815 he published his epochal and remarkably beautiful hand-painted map, more than eight feet tall and six feet wide. But four years after its triumphant publication, and with his young wife going steadily mad to the point of nymphomania, Smith ended up in debtors' prison, a victim of plagiarism, swindled out of his recognition and his profits. He left London for the north of England and remained homeless for ten long years as he searched for work. It wasn't until 1831, when his employer, a sympathetic nobleman, brought him into contact with the Geological Society of London -- which had earlier denied him a fellowship -- that at last this quiet genius was showered with the honors long overdue him. He was summoned south to receive the society's highest award, and King William IV offered him a lifetime pension.</p><p><em>The Map That Changed the World</em>&nbsp;is, at its foundation, a very human tale of endurance and achievement, of one man's dedication in the face of ruin and homelessness. The world's coal and oil industry, its gold mining, its highway systems, and its railroad routes were all derived entirely from the creation of Smith's first map.; and with a keen eye and thoughtful detail, Simon Winchester unfolds the poignant sacrifice behind this world-changing discovery.</p></p><p>Once upon a time there lived a man who discovered the secrets of the earth. He traveled far and wide, learning about the world below the surface. After years of toil, he created a great map of the underworld and expected to live happily ever after. But did he? Simon Winchester (<i>The Professor and the Madman</i>) tells the fossil-friendly fairy tale life of William Smith in <i>The Map That Changed the World</i>.<p> Born to humble parents, Smith was also a child of the Industrial Revolution (the year of his birth, 1769, also saw Josiah Wedgwood open his great factory, Etruria, Richard Arkwright create his first water-powered cotton-spinning frame, and James Watt receive the patent for the first condensing steam engine). While working as surveyor in a coal mine, Smith noticed the abrupt changes in the layers of rock as he was lowered into the depths. He came to understand that the different layers--in part as revealed by the fossils they contained--always appeared in the same order, no matter where they were found. He also realized that geology required a three-dimensional approach. Smith spent the next 20 some years traveling throughout Britain, observing the land, gathering data, and chattering away about his theories to those he met along the way, thus acquiring the nickname "Strata Smith." In 1815 he published his masterpiece: an 8.5- by 6-foot, hand-tinted map revealing "A Delineation of the Strata of England and Wales."</p><p> Despite this triumph, Smith's road remained more rocky than smooth. Snubbed by the gentlemanly Geological Society, Smith complained that "the theory of geology is in the possession of one class of men, the practice in another." Indeed, some members of the society went further than mere ostracism--they stole Smith's work. These cartographic plagiarists produced their own map, remarkably similar to Smith's, in 1819. Meanwhile the chronically cash-strapped Smith had been forced to sell his prized fossil collection and was eventually consigned to debtor's prison.</p><p> In the end, the villains are foiled, our hero restored, and science triumphs. Winchester clearly relishes his happy ending, and his honey-tinged prose ("that most attractively lovable losterlike Paleozoic arthropod known as the trilobite") injects a lot of life into what seems, on the surface, a rather dry tale. Like Smith, however, Winchester delves into the strata beneath the surface and reveals a remarkable world. <i>--Sunny Delaney</i></p><p>In 1793, a canal digger named William Smith made a startling discovery. He found that by tracing the placement of fossils, which he uncovered in his excavations, one could follow layers of rocks as they dipped and rose and fell&#x2014;clear across England and, indeed, clear across the world&#x2014;making it possible, for the first time ever, to draw a chart of the hidden underside of the earth. Smith spent twenty-two years piecing together the fragments of this unseen universe to create an epochal and remarkably beautiful hand-painted map. But instead of receiving accolades and honors, he ended up in debtors' prison, the victim of plagiarism, and virtually homeless for ten years more. </p><p><em>The Map That Changed the World</em> is a very human tale of endurance and achievement, of one man's dedication in the face of ruin. With a keen eye and thoughtful detail, Simon Winchester unfolds the poignant sacrifice behind this world-changing discovery.</p></p><h2>Just Like Jesus: Learning to Have a Heart Like His (2) (The Bestseller Collection)</h2><p><p>God loves you just the way you are, but he refuses to leave you there. He wants you to be just like Jesus.</p><p>Can you think of a better offer?</p><p>Jesus felt no guilt; God wants you to feel no guilt. Jesus had no bad habits; God wants to do away with yours. Jesus had no fears; God wants the same for you. Jesus had no anxiety about death; you needn't either. God's desire, his plan, his ultimate goal is to make you into the image of Christ.</p><p>But how does this change occur? And why does the change seem so slow? If God wants me to be just like Jesus, why do I still seem just like me?</p><p>In <em>Just Like Jesus</em>, Max Lucado helps you answer these questions. He helps you understand God's wonderful ways of transformation. Would you like to know more? Then read on. And remember: <em>God loves you just way you are, but he refuses to leave you there. He wants you to be just like Jesus.</em></p></p><p><i>"What if for 24 hours Jesus wakes up in your bed, walks in your shoes, lives in your house, assumes your schedule?... What if for one day Jesus lives your life with his heart?</i><p> Within these opening lines lies the premise of Max Lucado's book about the possibility of becoming "just like Jesus." In recounting the biblical stories of Jesus' life and deeds, Lucado then explains how Jesus' acts of compassion, forgiveness, honesty, and faith can be reflected in anyone's everyday life. Lucado's concrete analogy of "just like Jesus" helps many readers grasp the fundamentals of Christianity in a new and inspiring way. Furthermore, in taking on the values, heart and deeds of Jesus, Lucado believes, Christians can expect a richer, more accessible relationship with God. "Jesus had unbroken communion with his father," writes Lucado. "Do you suppose the Father desires the same for us? Absolutely ... God has the same abiding intimacy with you that he had with his son."</p><p> One of the reasons that Lucado's popularity has soared is that he combines straightforward storytelling skills with simple, unfettered theology to explain how Christianity influences modern life, from marriage and career to golf games and traffic jams. Fans will also appreciate his companion study guide at the end of the book, which offers provocative questions relating to the themes of each chapter. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p><p>Since entering the ministry in 1978, Max Lucado has served churches in Miami, Florida; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and San Antonio, Texas.

I am only twenty-one, my parents gave me love and an education, and I married a woman I love and who loves me in return. However, tomorrow, life will undertake to separate us, and we must each set off in search of our own path, our own destiny or our own way of facing death.<br><br>As far as our family is concerned, today is the fourteenth of July, 1099. For the family of Yakob, the childhood friend with whom I used to play in this city of Jerusalem, it is the year 4859&#x2014;he always takes great pride in telling me that Judaism is a far older religion than mine. For the worthy Ibn al-Athir, who spent his life trying to record a history that is now coming to a conclusion, the year 492 is about to end. We do not agree about dates or about the best way to worship God, but in every other respect we live together in peace.<br><br>A week ago, our commanders held a meeting. The French soldiers are infinitely superior and far better equipped than ours. We were given a choice: to abandon the city or fight to the death, because we will certainly be defeated. Most of us decided to stay.<br><br>The Muslims are, at this moment, gathered at the Al-Aqsa mosque, while the Jews choose to assemble their soldiers in Mihrab Dawud, and the Christians, who live in various different quarters, are charged with defending the southern part of the city.<br><br>Outside, we can already see the siege towers built from the enemy&#x2019;s dismantled ships. Judging from the enemy&#x2019;s movements, we assume that they will attack tomorrow morning, spilling our blood in the name of the Pope, the &#x201c;liberation&#x201d; of the city, and the &#x201c;divine will.&#x201d;<br><br>This evening, in the same square where, a millennium ago, the Roman governor Pontius Pilate handed Jesus over to the mob to be crucified, a group of men and women of all ages went to see the Greek, whom we all know as the Copt.<br><br>The Copt is a strange man. As an adolescent, he decided to leave his native city of Athens to go in search of money and adventure. He ended up knocking on the doors of our city, close to starvation. When he was well received, he gradually abandoned the idea of continuing his journey and resolved to stay.<br><br>He managed to find work in a shoemaker&#x2019;s shop, and&#x2014;just like Ibn al-Athir&#x2014;he started recording every- thing he saw and heard for posterity. He did not seek to join any particular religion, and no one tried to persuade him otherwise. As far as he is concerned, we are not in the years 1099 or 4859, much less at the end of 492. The Copt believes only in the present moment and what he calls Moira&#x2014;the unknown god, the Divine Energy, responsible for a single law, which, if ever broken, will bring about the end of the world.<br><br>Alongside the Copt were the patriarchs of the three religions that had settled in Jerusalem. No government official was present during this conversation; they were too preoccupied with making the final preparations for a resistance that we believe will prove utterly pointless.<br><br>&#x201c;Many centuries ago, a man was judged and condemned in this square,&#x201d; the Greek said. &#x201c;On the road to the right, while he was walking toward his death, he passed a group of women. When he saw them weeping, he said: &#x2018;Weep not for me, weep for Jerusalem.&#x2019; He prophesied what is happening now. &#x2018;From tomorrow, harmony will become discord. Joy will be replaced by grief. Peace will give way to a war that will last into an unimaginably distant future.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>No one said anything, because none of us knew exactly why we were there. Would we have to listen to yet another sermon about these invaders calling themselves &#x201c;crusaders&#x201d;?<br><br>For a moment, the Copt appeared to savor the general confusion. And then, after a long silence, he explained:<br><br>&#x201c;They can destroy the city, but they cannot destroy everything the city has taught us, which is why it is vital that this knowledge does not suffer the same fate as our walls, houses, and streets. But what is knowledge?&#x201d;<br><br>When no one replied, he went on:<br><br>&#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t the absolute truth about life and death, but the thing that helps us to live and confront the challenges of day-to-day life. It isn&#x2019;t what we learn from books, which serves only to fuel futile arguments about what happened or will happen; it is the knowledge that lives in the hearts of men and women of good will.&#x201d;<br><br>The Copt said:<br><br>&#x201c;I am a learned man, and yet, despite having spent all these years restoring antiquities, classifying objects, recording dates, and discussing politics, I still don&#x2019;t know quite what to say to you. But I will ask the Divine Energy to purify my heart. You will ask me questions, and I will answer them. That is what the teachers of Ancient Greece did; their disciples would ask them questions about problems they had not yet considered, and the teachers would answer them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And what shall we do with your answers?&#x201d; someone asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Some will write down what I say. Others will remember my words. The important thing is that tonight you will set off for the four corners of the world, telling others what you have heard. That way, the soul of Jerusalem will be preserved. And one day, we will be able to rebuild Jerusalem, not just as a city, but as a center of knowledge and a place where peace will once again reign.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We all know what awaits us tomorrow,&#x201d; said another man. &#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t it be better to discuss how to negotiate for peace or prepare ourselves for battle?&#x201d;<br><br>The Copt looked at the other religious men beside him and then immediately turned back to the crowd.<br><br>&#x201c;None of us can know what tomorrow will hold, because each day has its good and its bad moments. So, when you ask your questions, forget about the troops outside and the fear inside. Our task is not to leave a record of what happened on this date for those who will inherit the Earth; history will take care of that. Therefore, we will speak about our daily lives, about the difficulties we have had to face. That is all the future will be interested in, because I do not believe very much will change in the next thousand years.&#x201d;</p><h2>Beach Bum Berry Remixed</h2><p><ul> <li>The global Tiki Drink revival is in full swing.

The parents are sent to one concentration camp, their son to another. Only his father's gift, a harmonica, keeps the boy's hopes alive and, miraculously, ensures his survival. When an officer discovers his talent, he makes the boy play each night. Through music the boy invokes his parents and brings comfort to the other prisoners, lifting their spirits if only for a moment at time. <br><br> Ron Mazellan's luminous artwork depicts the bleakness of the time, while letting the beauty that hope can bring through the darkness shine.</p><p>Tony Johnston is the author of over 100 books for children, including THE CAT WITH SEVEN NAMES and THE BARN OWLS. She lives in California.Gr. 3-6. Based on a true survivor story, this powerful picture book is yet another astonishing Holocaust account for discussion. A Polish Jewish child, blissfully happy with his loving parents, gets a harmonica from his coal-miner father and learns to play Schubert while his parents dance. The realistic mixed-media, double-page illustrations contrast that glowing warmth of home with the darkness that comes when Nazi soldiers break down the door, separate the boy from his family, and send him to the camps. His harmonica becomes his solace. The commandant hears about the child's playing. He orders the boy to play Schubert and throws him bread. In the end, however, the music does nothing to humanize the brutal Nazis. In fact, one unforgettable picture shows the commandant blissfully listening to the music, one hand over his heart and the other holding a whip. The home memories are idyllic, but there's absolutely no sentimentality about the child's survival. Johnston gives children and grown-ups lots to talk about here--for example, Can a person be both sensitive and cruel? <i>Hazel Rochman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

As a boy, he arrived in the United States legally with his family. Together they had traveled from Santo Domingo to seek medical care for his mother. Soon the family&#x2019;s visas lapsed, and Dan-el&#x2019;s father eventually returned home. But Dan-el&#x2019;s courageous mother decided to stay and make a better life for her bright sons in New York City. <br> &nbsp;<br> Without papers, she faced tremendous obstacles. While Dan-el was only in grade school, the family joined the ranks of the city&#x2019;s homeless. Dan-el, his mother, and brother lived in a downtown shelter where Dan-el&#x2019;s only refuge was the meager library. At another shelter he met Jeff, a young volunteer from a wealthy family. Jeff was immediately struck by Dan-el&#x2019;s passion for books and learning. With Jeff&#x2019;s help, Dan-el was accepted on scholarship to Collegiate, the oldest private school in the country.<br> &nbsp;<br> There, Dan-el thrived. Throughout his youth, Dan-el navigated two worlds: the rough streets of East Harlem, where he lived with his brother and his mother and tried to make friends, and the ultra-elite halls of a Manhattan private school, where he immersed himself in a world of books and rose to the top of his class.<br> &nbsp;<br> From Collegiate, Dan-el went on to Princeton, where he made the momentous decision to come out as an undocumented student in a <i>Wall Street Journal</i> profile a few months before he gave the salutatorian&#x2019;s traditional address in Latin at his commencement.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Undocumented</i> is essential reading for the debate on immigration, but it is also an unforgettable tale of a passionate young scholar coming of age in two very different worlds. <br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Praise for <i>Undocumented</i>:</b><br> &#x201c;<i>Undocumented </i>is an impassioned counterargument to those who feel, as did some of Peralta&#x2019;s more xenophobic classmates, that &#x2018;illegals&#x2019; are good-for-nothings who take jobs from Americans and deserve to be kicked out of the country. No one who reads this story of a brilliant young man and his proud mother will automatically equate undocumented immigrant with idle parasite. That stereotype is something else we shouldn&#x2019;t take for granted.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Minneapolis Star-Tribune</i><br><br> &#x201c;Dan-el Padilla Peralta&#x2019;s story is as compulsively readable as a novel, an all-American tall tale that just happens to be true.

What happened? Why did they think we had drugs? Did they say?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mi&#x2019;jo, it&#x2019;s going to be OK now. They made a big mistake. They had one cop who speaks a little Spanish explain to me what went wrong. They&#x2019;d received a call from someone who told them dealers were storing drugs in an apartment in our building. The cops thought the informant said &#x2018;Apartment 2B,&#x2019; so they came to our apartment&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So they were there when you got home from church?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;d knocked down the door. They were searching every�thing. They searched my bedroom, the table where I have the candles for the santos, the living room, the kitchen, the bedrooms.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do they still think we&#x2019;re involved with drug dealers?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ay, no, mi&#x2019;jo. So they&#x2019;re searching everywhere and I&#x2019;m telling them over and over again that they&#x2019;re wrong, that we&#x2019;re a family of God and I&#x2019;m just a single mother raising two children. I showed them all your books, I told them you go to a famous private school on full scholarship. But they wouldn&#x2019;t believe anything I told them. They just kept asking where the drugs were. But finally, finally, thank you, Virgin Mary, one of the police officers took out his radio and spoke with the police officers standing outside our building. That&#x2019;s when another cop came up to me and said they were extremely sorry. That it had all been a mistake, that they were supposed to be inves�tigating another apartment instead. And you should have seen them, Dan-el, how nice they were when they realized their mistake. They&#x2019;re even going to pay to have our door fixed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Those sinverg�enza cops!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dan-el! They were doing their job, my son. It&#x2019;s over now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Did they ask about our immi�gration status?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank God no, my son. They didn&#x2019;t ask me for papeles or anything like that.&#x201d;<br><br>I let out a small sigh of relief. Mom continued:<br><br>&#x201c;But I must have interrupted you, my son, you&#x2019;re still at school working on the newspaper, right? Everything&#x2019;s OK, I just wanted you to know what had happened. Get back to what you were doing and I&#x2019;ll see you at home for dinner. Dios te bendiga.&#x201d;<br><br>I returned to the computer room.

Through her true story, readers will learn what it was like to be part of this Native American community that lived along the Missouri River in the Dakotas, a society that depended more on agriculture for food and survival than on hunting. Children will relate to Buffalo Bird Girl&#x2019;s routine of chores and playing with friends, and they will also be captivated by her lifestyle and the dangers that came with it.<br> Using as a resource the works of Gilbert L. Wilson, who met Buffalo Bird Woman and transcribed her life&#x2019;s story in the early 20th century, award-winning author-illustrator S. D. Nelson has captured the spirit of Buffalo Bird Girl and her lost way of life.

Visit him online at www.sdnelson.net.<p></p>Drawing on Buffalo Bird Girl&#x2019;s historic personal accounts, this handsome picture-book biography tells her story in the first person about growing up American Indian on the Great Plains in the nineteenth century. Born in the Hidatsa tribe in Like-a-Fishhook Village, she is raised by loving grandparents and aunts after the devastating smallpox epidemic, brought by the whites, kills her parents. Despite the losses and hardships, which include brutal winter blizzards, she remembers a blissful childhood. Along with archival, sepia-tone photos, Nelson&#x2019;s moving pencil drawings and acrylic paintings show the girl and her community throughout the year: the women and girls harvesting, cooking, dressing up; the men hunting. Her grandmother teaches her to use a buffalo shoulder blade like a shovel. She loves the wonderful new luxuries the white traders bring, including kettles, sugar, and guns. But then comes the buffalo hunting for trade, the hides in piles like mountains. The personal focus is bound to spark discussion, and many readers will want to go on to the very lengthy informative notes.

Victoria lives in Pasadena, California, with her husband and their daughter.Gr 5&#x2013;8&#x2014;The long-awaited follow-up to The Girl Who Could Fly (Feiwel &amp; Friends, 2008) finds Piper ("the girl who could fly") and Conrad ("the boy who knew everything") living in relative calm on Piper's family farm. Some time has passed since they and their fellow exceptional children escaped Dr. Hellion's prison of a school, yet the calm lasts only briefly as a few disparate events quickly unfold and turn everything upside down. In quick succession, the near death of Piper's beloved father, his father's election to the presidency, and a successful experiment in time-bending spurs Conrad to finally step up as leader of their band of misfit children. Under Conrad's tutelage, the kids carry out anonymous goodwill missions in response to fishy "natural" disasters. Yet their mission proves far from straightforward. Who is behind these disasters? Is there indeed a secret place where exceptional kids are free to be themselves? As in its predecessor, this installment straddles the real and the imagined. At times, this blend coalesces beautifully, but often it proves a bit clunky. The folksy colloquialisms uttered by Piper and her parents still feel out of place, leaving readers a little unsettled as to the setting. Its greatest strength emerges when the tale balances quiet moments of self-realization, identity, and friendship with an action-packed plot.

It is one of seven uniformed services of the United States. In the civilian leadership structure of the United States military, the Marine Corps is a component of the Department of the Navy, often working closely with U.S. naval forces for training, transportation and logistic purposes; however, in the military leadership structure the Marine Corps is a separate branch. The United States Marine Corps is the smallest of the United States&#39; armed forces in the Department of Defense (the United States Coast Guard is smaller, about one-fifth the size of the Marine Corps, but is normally under the Department of Homeland Security). The Marine Corps is nonetheless larger than the entire armed forces of many significant military powers; for example, it is larger than the active duty Israel Defense Forces or the whole of the British Army. The Marine Corps accounts for around six percent of the Military budget of the United States. The cost per Marine is $20,000 less than the cost of a serviceman from the other services, and the entire force can be used for both hybrid and major combat operations, that is, the Marines cover the entire Three Block War.</p><h2>Persuasion: (Special Edition) (Jane Austen Collection)</h2><p>In a publishing career that spanned less than a decade, Jane Austen revolutionized the literary romance, using it as a stage from which to address issues of gender politics and class-consciousness rarely expressed in her day.

While the cause of Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease is still a mystery, new research has increased our knowledge of certain aspects of the disease. Perhaps most significant, studies show that proper diet may make a real difference, not only in slowing the progression of AD, but also in preventing it. In this groundbreaking book, a notable expert on Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease has teamed up with a leading researcher of nutrition to create a unique guide to understanding and managing this serious condition. <strong><i>The Alzheimer</i><i>&#x2019;</i></strong><i><strong>s Prevention and Treatment Diet</strong> </i>outlines a cutting-edge nutritional program that will be of interest both to Alzheimer&#x2019;s patients and to anybody who wants to maintain optimal memory and mental agility for years to come. The book begins with an overview of Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease, outlining its symptoms, risk factors, diagnosis, and current treatment methods. You&#x2019;ll also learn how Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease differs from other forms of memory loss and cognitive impairment. Next, Drs. Isaacson and Ochner take a closer look at the impact of nutrition on your ability to think and remember, examining the effects of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins on the brain. Then, they share their innovative program for Alzheimer&#x2019;s prevention, showing you how to maximize your cognitive health through diet and exercise. Finally, the authors give tips for the caregiver on adapting and implementing the program for people who already have Alzheimer&#x2019;s, decreasing the speed with which symptoms worsen. If Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease is a concern for you or a loved one, <strong><i>The Alzheimer</i><i>&#x2019;</i><i>s Prevention and Treatment Diet </i></strong>will give you the information you need to fight back. Using Dr. Isaacson and Dr. Ochner&#x2019;s recommendations, you can put into practice what the evidence is showing us&#x2015;that what you eat can make all the difference for your mind.</p></p><p><p><i>Richard Isaacson, MD</i>, is the founder and director of the Alzheimer&#x2019;s Prevention Clinic at Weill Cornell Medicine and New York-Presbyterian, where he is also an Associate Professor of Neurology and director of the Neurology Residency Training Program. Dr. Isaacson completed his residency in neurology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center/Harvard Medical School and did his medical internship at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach, where he later became the associate medical director of the Wien Center for Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease.</p><p>The Alzheimer&#x2019;s epidemic may be the greatest public health crisis facing our world today. There are over 5 million Americans with Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease (AD), and millions more are affected throughout Canada, Europe, Australia, and the rest of the world. One out of nine people age sixty-five and over has dementia, and over a third of individuals over the age of eighty-five have AD. The increasing prevalence of Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease is due in part to the advancing age of our population. Advancing age is the primary risk factor for AD, and with more and more baby boomers turning sixty-five every year, the number of AD cases is projected to more than triple by the year 2050!<br><br>But while advancing age may be the biggest factor behind the rise of Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease, it is not the sole factor. Poor dietary habits also play an important role. It turns out that the foods you eat have an enormous effect on your risk of Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease. An unhealthy diet not only contributes to obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic syndrome&#x2015;all conditions that seem to increase the risk of dementia&#x2015;but may also directly influence the ways in which your brain works. Poor lifestyle habits, such as a lack of exercise, are also associated with a higher risk of AD.<br><br>The good news is that diet and other lifestyle practices are well within your control. Based on the most recent scientific research, and supported by our real-life experience helping patients, <strong><em>The Alzheimer&#x2019;s Prevention and Treatment Diet</em></strong> will give you the dietary strategies you need to enhance your well-being, strengthen the health of your brain, and improve your ability to fight Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease. We&#x2019;ve shared these strategies with our patients and our own family members, and now we&#x2019;d like to share them with you. That&#x2019;s because anyone and everyone&#x2015;be they nine or ninety years of age&#x2015;can make the lifestyle changes that lead to better health and cognition. Our goal is to guide you in making choices that will not only improve your overall well-being but also protect your brain.<br><br>The first four chapters of <strong><em>The Alzheimer&#x2019;s Prevention and Treatment Diet</em></strong> offer the information you need to understand Alzheimer&#x2019;s, the link between Alzheimer&#x2019;s and nutrition, and our diet program. Chapter 1 presents a comprehensive overview of Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease, detailing AD&#x2019;s stages and symptoms, explaining the difference between age-related cognitive decline and cognitive decline due to AD, and looking at the condition&#x2019;s causes and risk factors. The chapter ends with a brief discussion of AD diagnosis and AD research trials.<br><br>Chapter 2 zeroes in on our focus of prevention through diet by answering the question, &#x201c;Why does diet matter?&#x201d; The chapter first looks at the various ways in which foods can affect the brain. It then examines two nutrition-related health problems&#x2015;excess body fat and diabetes&#x2015;and discusses their association with Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease. Finally, it introduces new dietary concepts that may hold the keys to the future of AD prevention and treatment.<br><br>The dietary strategies and guidelines that form the foundation of the Alzheimer&#x2019;s Prevention and Treatment Diet are based on the effect that the substances known as <em>macronutrients</em>&#x2015;carbohydrates, protein, and fats&#x2015;have on health in general and brain health in particular. Chapter 3 provides basic information about these dietary components and explains how by carefully selecting both the quantity and the quality of your carbs, proteins, and fats, you can help protect brain and memory function.<br><br>Over the last few decades, there has been increased interest in the use of nutrition to enhance brain health and avoid or manage neurological disorders such as AD. Studies have explored a range of specific nutrients, specific foods, dietary patterns, and other approaches that that may have the potential to prevent or treat cognitive decline. Chapter 4 focuses on the most important of these studies and diets, including the Mediterranean diet, the ketogenic diet, the MIND diet, calorie-restrictive diets, and the FINGER study. It then turns its attention to the Alzheimer&#x2019;s Prevention and Treatment Diet, which takes into consideration all of the latest evidence on AD&#x2015;including the studies presented in the chapter&#x2015;but integrates unique elements that contribute to its effectiveness and accessibility.<br><br>Chapters 5, 6, and 7 put the information from the earlier chapters into action by presenting a practical guide to making dietary and other lifestyle changes necessary to prevent, delay the onset, or slow the progression of Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease. Here, you&#x2019;ll find what you need to know to protect and enhance your cognitive health.<br><br>Chapter 5 is a step-by-step guide to our nine-week diet plan. The chapter begins by explaining the dietary goals of the Alzheimer&#x2019;s Prevention and Treatment Diet. Then, for each week, we instruct you in planning and preparing for that week&#x2019;s dietary and lifestyle changes; provide specific dietary guidelines; and recommend exercise and other activities that can further enhance your cognitive well-being. This proven approach gradually introduces change into your life and also enables you to successfully face any challenges you may encounter, from eating on the go to dining out. Lists of recommended foods and brain-healthy snacks, a special section on meal replacements, and sample menus ease your transition to a brain-healthy lifestyle.<br><br>Although diet is one of the most important weapons we have in the fight against Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease, it is not the only weapon. Research has shown that the best way to prevent and treat Alzheimer&#x2019;s is to use a multifaceted approach that includes specific nutritional supplements, physical exercise, stimulating intellectual and social activities, and stress-reduction techniques. Chapter 6 guides you in successfully using these approaches to not only protect your brain but also enhance the quality of your everyday life.<br><br>As the name suggests, the Alzheimer&#x2019;s Prevention and Treatment Diet is designed to both prevent the development of cognitive problems and slow further decline in those who have already been diagnosed with the disease. However, as AD progresses, it can become difficult to maintain optimum nutrition. Chapter 7 explores the problems that may develop with the onset of AD symptoms and offers proven tips for managing them so that the person with AD can receive the best nutrition possible. Since diet can be affected&#x2015;for better or worse&#x2015;by medication, this chapter also looks at the medications most often prescribed to manage the symptoms of AD and guides you in timing meals and drug therapy so that they work hand in hand. Finally, Chapter 7 provides helpful tips and strategies for caregivers and others who have people with AD in their life.<br><br>We have tried to make the information in this book easy to understand and to keep the use of medical- and nutrition-related terminology to a minimum. You will not need a medical degree to understand the science behind our diet program! But some terminology is necessary to explain brain function and the impact that foods and their nutrients have on the body. With this in mind, we created a <em>Glossary</em> (page 215) that defines the terms used in our book. Turn to it whenever you want to double-check the meaning of a word or phrase with which you&#x2019;re not familiar.<br><br>Throughout the book, we emphasize the importance of understanding AD as well as the effect that nutrition can have on your brain so that you can make the best dietary choices possible. This book provides a solid foundation of knowledge, but it&#x2019;s important that you have access to further information so that you can continue to follow a healthy diet throughout your life. That&#x2019;s why we have compiled a comprehensive Resources list, which not only guides you to websites that can offer detailed nutritional data, but also suggests organizations and sites that provide a wealth of information on Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease, its risk factors, its stages, its management, and other topics of interest. Also included are organizations geared to assist family members who serve as caregivers for people with AD.<br><br>Finally, we&#x2019;ve given you charts to help you track your progress in adopting a brain-healthy diet. In these charts, you&#x2019;ll record food intake; jot down the carbohydrate counts that are so important to the APT Diet; and make lists of favorite foods, brain-healthy snacks, and more&#x2015;all with the goal of helping you implement positive changes. If you prefer, you can track your progress online with the Alzheimer&#x2019;s Disease-Nutrition Tracking System (AD-NTS), which is available on the Alzheimer&#x2019;s Universe website. (See page 232 of the <em>Resources</em> list.)<br><br>Everybody has the potential to lead a brain-healthier life, and our gradual approach to dietary and lifestyle changes maximizes your chance of success. As you continue on the Alzheimer&#x2019;s Prevention and Treatment Program, remember that Rome wasn&#x2019;t built in a day, and neither is a brain-protective lifestyle. Over time, the small changes you start implementing today will pay off. There is no is more important investment than the investment you make in your health.</p></p><h2>Official Rules of Card Games</h2><p>With complete rules on more than 300 popular card games, including the new international laws of contract bridge, this comprehensive book also includes special sections on: choosing games for particular occasions, teaching card games to children, the etiquette of card games, technical terms used in card games, and more.</p><p>e rules on more than 300 popular card games, including the new international laws of contract bridge, this comprehensive book also includes special sections on: choosing games for particular occasions, teaching card games to children, the etiquette of card games, technical terms used in card games, and more.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i><b>Albert H.

Turturro is also known for his television roles on <i>Monk</i>, for which he won an Emmy, and most recently HBO's <i>The Night Of</i>, for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe and a SAG award."In this exciting photo-heavy cookbook, graphic designer Paterna celebrates the culinary heritage of the Italian-Americans of Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. He shares dozens of beautiful family photos and anecdotes (beneath photos of his maternal grandparents&#x2019; passports, he writes: &#x201c;My grandfather promised he would bring her back to America as his bride&#x201d;) that span three generations. Paterna&#x2019;s mother, Anne, typed out dozens of the family&#x2019;s recipes on index cards and carefully converted &#x201c;pinches&#x201d; and &#x201c;approximate timings&#x201d; into real measures. Some of her recipe cards that have made their way into this book include baccala with caramelized bell peppers, lasagna, and squid stuffed with pine nuts and raisins. Paterna points out on which holidays these dishes are traditionally prepared, such as fried pizza for Good Friday, roasted lamb with asparagus for Easter Sunday, and struffoli (&#x201c;a crusty, honey-soaked, Neopolitan dessert&#x201d;) for Christmas Day. Paterna takes readers on a tour of Brooklyn&#x2019;s many Italian specialty shops and shares stories of the business owners (Fredo at Queen Ann Ravioli &#x201c;still repairs his 1912... pasta machine himself&#x201d;). This distinctive blend of memoir and cookbook is nostalgia catnip for Italian-Americans." <b>&#x2013;Publishers Weekly</b></p><h2>Sufficiently Advanced Magic (Arcane Ascension)</h2><p>Five years ago, Corin Cadence&#x2019;s brother entered the Serpent Spire &#x2014; a colossal tower with ever-shifting rooms, traps, and monsters.

The sign shows three beagles cornering a fox. They&#x2019;re about to pounce and rip it apart. A street sign underneath says westwood road. Lords and ladies are supposed to be rich, so I was expecting swimming pools and Lamborghinis, but Westwood Road looks pretty normal to me. Normal brick houses, detached or semi�detached, with little front gardens and normal cars. The damp sky&#x2019;s the color of old hankies. Seven magpies fly by. Seven&#x2019;s good. Mum&#x2019;s face is inches away from mine, though I&#x2019;m not sure if that&#x2019;s an angry face or a worried one.<br><br> &#x201c;Nathan? Are you even listening?&#x201d; Mum&#x2019;s wearing make�up today. That shade of lipstick&#x2019;s called Morning Lilac but it smells more like Pritt Stick than lilacs. Mum&#x2019;s face hasn&#x2019;t gone away, so I say, &#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s &#x2018;Pardon&#x2019; or &#x2018;Excuse me.&#x2019; Not &#x2018;What?&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I say, which often does the trick.<br><br> Not today. &#x201c;Did you hear what I told you?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c; &#x2018;It&#x2019;s &#x201c;Pardon&#x201d; or &#x201c;Excuse me.&#x201d; Not &#x201c;What?&#x201d; &#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Before that! I said, if anyone at Lady Grayer&#x2019;s asks how we came here, you&#x2019;re to tell them we arrived by taxi.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I thought lying was wrong.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;There&#x2019;s lying,&#x201d; says Mum, fishing out the envelope she wrote the directions on from her handbag, &#x201c;which <i>is</i> wrong, and there&#x2019;s creating the right impression, which is necessary. If your father paid what he&#x2019;s supposed to pay, we really would have arrived by taxi. Now&nbsp;. . .&#x201d; Mum squints at her writing. &#x201c;Slade Alley leads off Westwood Road, about halfway down&nbsp;. . .&#x201d; She checks her watch.<br><br>&#x201c;Right, it&#x2019;s ten to three, and we&#x2019;re due at three. Chop-chop. Don&#x2019;t dawdle.&#x201d; Off Mum walks.<br> I follow, not stepping on any of the cracks. Sometimes I have to guess where the cracks are because the pavement&#x2019;s mushy with fallen leaves. At one point I had to step out of the way of a man with huge fists jogging by in a black and orange tracksuit. Wolverhampton Wanderers play in black and orange. Shining berries hang from a mountain ash. I&#x2019;d like to count them, but the <i>clip-�clop-�clip-�clop</i> of Mum&#x2019;s heels pulls me on. She bought the shoes at John Lewis&#x2019;s sale with the last of the money the Royal College of Music paid her, even though British Telecom sent a final reminder to pay the telephone bill. She&#x2019;s wearing her dark blue concert outfit and her hair up with the silver fox-�head hairpin. Her dad brought it back from Hong Kong after World War Two. When Mum&#x2019;s teaching a student and I have to make myself scarce, I sometimes go to Mum&#x2019;s dressing table and get the fox out. He&#x2019;s got jade eyes and on some days he smiles, on others he doesn&#x2019;t. I don&#x2019;t feel well knitted today, but the Valium should kick in soon. Valium&#x2019;s great. I took two pills. I&#x2019;ll have to miss a few next week so Mum won&#x2019;t notice her supply&#x2019;s going down. My tweed jacket&#x2019;s scratchy. Mum got it from Oxfam specially for today, and the bow �tie&#x2019;s from Oxfam, too. Mum volunteers there on Mondays so she can get the best of the stuff people bring in on Saturdays. If Gaz Ingram or anyone in his gang sees me in this bow tie, I&#x2019;ll find a poo in my locker, guaranteed. Mum says I have to learn how to Blend In more, but there aren&#x2019;t any classes for Blending In, not even on the town library notice board. There&#x2019;s a Dungeons &amp; Dragons club advertised there, and I always want to go, but Mum says I can&#x2019;t because Dungeons &amp; Dragons is playing with dark forces. Through one front window I see horse racing. That&#x2019;s <i>Grandstand</i> on BBC1. The next three windows have net curtains, but then I see a TV with wrestling on it. That&#x2019;s Giant Haystacks the hairy baddie fighting Big Daddy the bald goodie on ITV. Eight houses later I see <i>Godzilla</i> on BBC2. He knocks down a pylon just by blundering into it and a Japanese fireman with a sweaty face is shouting into a radio. Now Godzilla&#x2019;s picked up a train, which makes no sense because amphibians don&#x2019;t have thumbs. Maybe Godzilla&#x2019;s thumb&#x2019;s like a panda&#x2019;s so-�called thumb, which is really an evolved claw. Maybe&#x2014;�<br><br> &#x201c;Nathan!&#x201d; Mum&#x2019;s got my wrist. &#x201c;What did I say about dawdling?&#x201d;<br><br> I check back. &#x201c; &#x2018;Chop-�chop!&#x2019;; &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t dawdle.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;So what are you doing now?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Thinking about Godzilla&#x2019;s thumbs.&#x201d;<br><br> Mum shuts her eyes. &#x201c;Lady Grayer has invited me&#x2014;�us&#x2014;�to a musical gathering. A soir�e. There&#x2019;ll be people who care about music there. People from the Arts Council, people who award jobs, grants.&#x201d; Mum&#x2019;s eyes have tiny red veins like rivers photographed from very high up. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d rather you were at home playing with your Battle of the Boers landscape too, but Lady Grayer insisted you come along, so&nbsp;. . . you <i>have</i> to act normal. Can you do that? Please? Think of the most normal boy in your class, and do what he&#x2019;d do.&#x201d;<br><br> Acting Normal&#x2019;s like Blending In. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll try. But it&#x2019;s not the Battle of the Boers, it&#x2019;s the Boer War. Your ring&#x2019;s digging into my wrist.&#x201d;<br><br> Mum lets go of my wrist. That&#x2019;s better.<br><br> I don&#x2019;t know what her face is saying.<br><br> <i>�</i> <br><br> Slade Alley&#x2019;s the narrowest alley I&#x2019;ve ever seen. It slices between two houses, then vanishes left after thirty paces or so. I can imagine a tramp living there in a cardboard box, but not a lord and lady.<br><br> &#x201c;No doubt there&#x2019;ll be a proper entrance on the far side,&#x201d; says Mum. &#x201c;Slade House is only the Grayers&#x2019; town residence. Their proper home&#x2019;s in Cambridgeshire.&#x201d;<br><br> If I had 50p for every time Mum&#x2019;s told me that, I&#x2019;d now have �3.50. It&#x2019;s cold and clammy in the alley like White Scar Cave in the Yorkshire Dales. Dad took me when I was ten. I find a dead cat lying on the ground at the first corner. It&#x2019;s gray like dust on the moon. I know it&#x2019;s dead because it&#x2019;s as still as a dropped bag, and because big flies are drinking from its eyes. How did it die? There&#x2019;s no bullet wound or fang marks, though its head&#x2019;s at a slumped angle so maybe it was strangled by a cat-�strangler. It goes straight into the Top Five of the Most Beautiful Things I&#x2019;ve Ever Seen. Maybe there&#x2019;s a tribe in Papua New Guinea who think the droning of flies is music. Maybe I&#x2019;d fit in with them. &#x201c;Come along, Nathan.&#x201d; Mum&#x2019;s tugging my sleeve.<br> I ask, &#x201c;Shouldn&#x2019;t it have a funeral? Like Gran did?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No. Cats aren&#x2019;t human beings. Come along.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Shouldn&#x2019;t we tell its owner it won&#x2019;t be coming home?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;How? Pick it up and go along Westwood Road knocking on all the doors saying, &#x2018;Excuse me, is this your cat?&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br> Mum sometimes has good ideas. &#x201c;It&#x2019;d take a bit of time, but&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;<i>Forget</i> it, Nathan&#x2014;�we&#x2019;re due at Lady Grayer&#x2019;s right now.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But if we don&#x2019;t bury it, crows&#x2019;ll peck out its eyes.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t have a spade or a garden round here.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Lady Grayer should have a spade and a garden.&#x201d;<br><br> Mum closes her eyes again. Maybe she&#x2019;s got a headache. &#x201c;This conversation is over.&#x201d; She pulls me away and we go down the middle section of Slade Alley. It&#x2019;s about five houses long, I&#x2019;d guess, but hemmed in by brick walls so high you can&#x2019;t see anything. Just sky. &#x201c;Keep your eyes peeled for a small black iron door,&#x201d; says Mum, &#x201c;set into the right-�hand wall.&#x201d; But we walk all the way to the next corner, and it&#x2019;s ninety-�six paces exactly, and thistles and dandelions grow out of cracks, but there&#x2019;s no door. After the right turn we go another twenty paces until we&#x2019;re out on the street parallel to Westwood Road. A sign says cranbury avenue. Parked opposite&#x2019;s a St. John ambulance.<br><br> Someone&#x2019;s written clean me in the dirt above the back wheel. The driver&#x2019;s got a broken nose and he&#x2019;s speaking into a radio. A mod drives past on a scooter like off <i>Quadro�phenia</i>, riding without a helmet. &#x201c;Riding without a helmet&#x2019;s against the law,&#x201d; I say.<br><br> &#x201c;Makes no sense,&#x201d; says Mum, staring at the envelope.<br><br> &#x201c;Unless you&#x2019;re a Sikh with a turban. Then the police&#x2019;ll&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c; &#x2018;A small black iron door&#x2019;: I mean&nbsp;. . . how did we miss it?&#x201d;<br><br> I know. For me, Valium&#x2019;s like Asterix&#x2019;s magic potion, but it makes Mum dopey. She called me Frank yesterday&#x2014;�Dad&#x2019;s name&#x2014;�and didn&#x2019;t notice. She gets two prescriptions for Valium from two doctors because one&#x2019;s not enough, but&#x2014;�<br><br> &#x2014;�a dog barks just inches away and I&#x2019;ve shouted and jumped back in panic and peed myself a bit, but it&#x2019;s okay, it&#x2019;s okay, there&#x2019;s a fence, and it&#x2019;s only a small yappy dog, it&#x2019;s not a bull mastiff, it&#x2019;s not <i>that</i> bull mastiff, and it was only a bit of pee. Still, my heart&#x2019;s hammering like mad and I feel like I might puke. Mum&#x2019;s gone out into Cranbury Avenue to look for big gates to a big house, and hasn&#x2019;t even noticed the yappy dog. A bald man in overalls walks up, carrying a bucket and a pair of stepladders over his shoulder. He&#x2019;s whistling &#x201c;I&#x2019;d Like to Teach the World to Sing (in Perfect Harmony).&#x201d;<br><br> Mum cuts in. &#x201c;Excuse me, do you know Slade House?&#x201d;<br><br> The whistling and the man stop. &#x201c;Do I know What House?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Slade House. It&#x2019;s Lady Norah Grayer&#x2019;s residence.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No idea, but if you find Her Ladyship, tell her I fancy a &nbsp;bit o&#x2019; posh if she fancies a bit o&#x2019; rough.&#x201d; He tells me, &#x201c;Love the dickie bow, son,&#x201d; and turns into Slade Alley, picking up his whistling where he left off. Mum looks at his back, muttering, &#x201c;Thanks a heap for bloody nothing.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I thought we weren&#x2019;t supposed to say &#x2018;bloody&#x2019;&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t start, Nathan. Just&#x2014;�don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br> I think that&#x2019;s Mum&#x2019;s angry face. &#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;<br><br> The dog&#x2019;s stopped yapping to lick its willy. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll backtrack,&#x201d; Mum decides. &#x201c;Maybe Lady Grayer meant the next alley along.&#x201d; She goes back into Slade Alley and I follow. We reach the middle section in time to see the stepladder man vanish around the corner of the far end, where the moon-�gray cat&#x2019;s still lying dead. &#x201c;If someone killed you down here,&#x201d; I remark, &#x201c;nobody&#x2019;d see.&#x201d;<br><br> Mum ignores me. Maybe it wasn&#x2019;t very Normal. We&#x2019;re halfway down the middle bit when Mum stops: &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be <i>jiggered</i>!&#x201d; There&#x2019;s a small black iron door, set into the brick wall. It&#x2019;s small all right. I&#x2019;m four feet eleven inches, and it&#x2019;s only up to my eyes. A fat person&#x2019;d need to squeeze hard to get through. It has no handle, keyhole, or gaps around the edges. It&#x2019;s black, nothing-�black, like the gaps between stars. &#x201c;How on earth did we miss that?&#x201d; says Mum. &#x201c;Some Boy Scout <i>you</i> are.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not in the Scouts anymore,&#x201d; I remind her. Mr. Moody our scoutmaster told me to get lost, so I did, and it took the Snowdonia mountain rescue service two days to find my shelter. I&#x2019;d been on the local news and everything. Everyone was angry, but I was only following orders.<br><br> Mum pushes the door, but it stays shut. &#x201c;How on earth does the bally thing open? Perhaps we ought to knock.&#x201d;<br><br> The door pulls my palm up against it. It&#x2019;s warm.<br><br> And as it swings inwards, the hinges shriek like brakes&nbsp;. . . <br><br> <i>�</i> <br> . . . and we&#x2019;re looking into a garden; a buzzing, still-summery garden. The garden&#x2019;s got roses, toothy sunflowers, spatters of poppies, clumps of foxgloves, and lots of flowers I can&#x2019;t name. There&#x2019;s a rockery, a pond, bees grazing and butterflies. It&#x2019;s epic. &#x201c;Cop a load of <i>that</i>,&#x201d; says Mum. Slade House is up at the top, old, blocky, stern and gray and half smothered by fiery ivy, and not at all like the houses on Westwood Road and Cranbury Avenue. If it was owned by the National Trust they&#x2019;d charge you �2 to get in, or 75p for children under sixteen. Mum and I have already stepped in through the small black iron door, which the wind closed like an unseen butler, and currents are pulling us up the garden, around by the wall. &#x201c;The Grayers must have a full-�time gardener,&#x201d; says Mum, &#x201c;or even several of them.&#x201d; At last, I feel my Valium kicking in. Reds are glossier, blues glassier, greens steamier and whites see-�through like one layer of a two-�ply tissue. I&#x2019;m about to ask Mum how such a big house and its garden can possibly fit in the space between Slade Alley and Cranbury Avenue, but my question falls down a deep well with no bottom, and I forget what I&#x2019;ve forgotten.<br><br> &#x201c;Mrs. Bishop and son, I presume,&#x201d; says an invisible boy. Mum jumps, a bit like me with the yappy dog, but now my Valium&#x2019;s acting like a shock absorber. &#x201c;Up here,&#x201d; says the voice. Mum and me look up. Sitting on the wall, about fifteen feet up I&#x2019;d say, is a boy who looks my age. He&#x2019;s got wavy hair, pouty lips, milky skin, blue jeans, pumps but no socks and a white T-�shirt. Not an inch of tweed, and no bow �tie. Mum never said anything about other boys at Lady Grayer&#x2019;s musical soir�e. Other boys mean questions have to get settled. Who&#x2019;s coolest? Who&#x2019;s hardest? Who&#x2019;s brainiest? Normal boys care about this stuff and kids &nbsp;like Gaz Ingram fight about it. Mum&#x2019;s saying, &#x201c;Yes, hello, I&#x2019;m Mrs. Bishop and this is Nathan&#x2014;�look, that wall&#x2019;s jolly high, you know. Don&#x2019;t you think you ought to come down?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Good to meet you, Nathan,&#x201d; says the boy.<br><br> &#x201c;Why?&#x201d; I ask the soles of the boy&#x2019;s pumps.<br><br> Mum&#x2019;s hissing something about manners and the boy says, &#x201c;Just because. I&#x2019;m Jonah, by the way. Your welcoming committee.&#x201d;<br><br> I don&#x2019;t know any Jonahs. It&#x2019;s a maroon-�colored name.<br><br> Mum asks, &#x201c;And is Lady Norah your mother, Jonah?&#x201d;<br><br> Jonah considers this. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s say she is, yes.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Right,&#x201d; says Mum, &#x201c;that&#x2019;s, um, I see. Do&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, splendid, Rita, you&#x2019;ve found us!&#x201d; A woman walks out from a lattice-�frame tunnel thing. The tunnel&#x2019;s smothered with bunches of dangly white and purple flowers.

At least she tried very hard to be good.She did her homework without being told. She ate all her vegetables, even the slimy ones. And she never talked back to her nanny, Miss Barmy, although it was almost impossible to keep quiet, some days.Of course no one can keep this kind of thing up forever. But Miss Barmy had told Emmy that if she were a good girl, her parents would probably want to see her more often; and so Emmy kept on bravely trying.So far it hadn't helped. Emmy's parents went on one vacation after another--to Paris, to Salamanca, to the Isle of Bugaloo--and hardly ever seemed to come home, or even to miss her at all."If you did better in school, I'm sure they would be pleased," said Miss Barmy, admiring her polished fingernails.This was unjust. "My last report card was all A's," Emmy said sturdily, remembering how hard she had worked for them."But not a single A+, dear." Miss Barmy smiled sweetly, checking her lipstick in a pocket mirror. "And how are your ballet lessons coming? Are you getting any less clumsy?"Emmy's shoulders slumped. She had tripped just last week."Really, Emmaline, your parents might pay attention to you, if you ever did anything worth paying attention <i>to.</i> Why don't you bring home some more ribbons and trophies?""I have a whole shelfful," Emmy said faintly."You'll just have to try a little harder, dear. Fill <i>two</i> shelves."So Emmy did. Not that anyone noticed.Still, Miss Barmy said that good girls didn't care too much about being noticed--so Emmy tried not to care.She really was a little <i>too</i> good.Which is why she liked to sit by the Rat.The Rat was not good at all.When the children at Grayson Lake Elementaryreached in to feed him, he snapped at their fingers. When they had a little trouble with fractions, he sneered. And he often made cutting remarks in a low voice when the teacher was just out of earshot.Emmy was the only one who heard him. And even she wondered sometimes if she was just imagining things.&nbsp;<br>One Wednesday in May, when not one person had seemed to notice her all morning, Emmy asked to stay indoors for recess. "I have spelling to study," she explained to Mr. Herbifore.The teacher, hurrying out after his class, didn't look at her as he nodded permission. At least Emmy <i>thought</i> he had nodded."Thank you," said Emmy. And then she heard something that sounded oddly like a snort.She looked at the Rat, and he snorted again. He was scowling, as usual."Why are you always so mean?" Emmy wondered aloud.She didn't expect the Rat to answer. She'd tried to speak to him before, and he had always pretended not to hear.But this time he curled his upper lip. "Why are <i>you</i> always so <i>good</i>?"Emmy was too startled to respond.The Rat shrugged one furry shoulder. "It doesn't get you anywhere. Just look at you--missing recess to study words you could spell in your sleep--and the only thing that happens is, you get ignored."Emmy looked away. It was true.Her parents never answered the letters she sent, even though she copied them over for neatness and gave them to Miss Barmy to mail.Her teacher kept forgetting her name, even though she had made a placard for her desk that said EMMY in big red letters edged with silver glitter.And she didn't want to tell the Rat, but she didn't mind missing recess at all. For Emmy, recess was a time when she felt more alone than ever."The bad ones get all the attention," said the Rat. "Try being bad for once. You might like it."Emmy thought about being bad. It had its appeal.If she were bad, she could stick out her tongue at Miss Barmy. She could call her parents long distance whenever she wanted. She could climb on her deskin school and scream until the other kids <i>had</i> to notice her ..."No one will like me if I'm bad," she said."No one likes you anyway," said the Rat bluntly.Emmy frowned. "Well, they don't <i>dis</i>like me.""That's right," the Rat answered promptly. "Nobody likes you, nobody dislikes you, nobody cares about you either way. You're a big nothing, if you ask me.""I didn't," said Emmy with some spirit.The Rat's whiskers twitched. "That's the first time I've heard you sound like anything but a piece of wet bread. Why don't you stand up for yourself more often?""Listen," Emmy said, "it's not like I don't <i>try</i>--""Yesterday, when that girl with the ponytail butted in line, you let her. And when that kid who sits across from you, the soccer star, the freckled one with hair that looks like a haystack--""Joe Benson.""Yeah, him. Well, when Haystack Hair was walking backward and stepped on your foot, <i>you</i> said 'Sorry.'""I was just being nice," said Emmy, stung."You're <i>too</i> nice," said the Rat sharply. "A little meanness is good for the soul. I highly recommend it."Emmy lifted her chin. "Being mean doesn't get <i>you</i> anywhere. Nobody pets you. Nobody plays with you.""I get what I want," said the Rat, showing his long, yellow teeth. "I get respect, which is more than I can say for you."Emmy glared at him. "<i>You</i> get respect? You live in a <i>cage.</i>"The Rat looked stunned."Well, it's true," Emmy said crossly. "Don't tell me you haven't noticed. You know, the bars, the lock on the door ..."The Rat's whiskers trembled. "You're not being very nice.""Nice? I thought a little meanness was good for the--""Most people don't mention it. Most people know better than to taunt a rodent about his ... unfortunate situation.""Look, <i>you</i> were the one who said--""It's not <i>my</i> fault I'm locked up!" The Rat's voice quavered pathetically. "I committed no crime! Have Isurvived kidnapping from the nest, unjust imprisonment, and absolutely appalling food"--he gave his dish of pellets a contemptuous kick--"only to be mocked by a little child?""I'm bigger than you," Emmy began hotly, "and you were the one who said I shouldn't be so nice--""But not to me! It's different when you're mean to <i>me</i>!""Oh, right," said Emmy.There was a thunder of footsteps and a clatter of voices in the hall. Emmy watched resignedly as her classmates poured in, laughing and talking. They all seemed friendly enough--to one another--but no matter how Emmy tried, they just looked right through her as though she weren't there.Why were things so different here? At her old school, she had had lots of friends. But then her parents had inherited all that money and moved across town to live in Great-Great-Uncle William's old mansion on the shores of Grayson Lake, and after that a lot of things had changed.Maybe it's me, Emmy thought dismally. Maybe I've turned into some horrible person and I don't even know it.She opened a book and bent her head, letting her straight brown hair fall around her face like a curtain. But as the children around her quieted down, she heard a small sob.Emmy peeked sideways. The Rat had retreated to the far corner of his cage, his face buried in his forepaws. He looked as if he were sleeping. But Emmy saw the Rat's gray shoulders heave, and after a while one small paw emerged to wipe the corner of his eye.Poor Rat. For all his tough talk, he was awfully sensitive. Apparently she shouldn't have mentioned his cage."Sorry," she whispered. And then the phone on the teacher's desk rang."Emma? Emmaline Addison?" Mr. Herbifore gazed out over the heads of his students.Emmy stood up."No, I don't see her," he said into the phone.Joe Benson snickered.Emmy walked forward and stood by the teacher's desk. What did she have to do, she wondered, bewildered. Throw firecrackers under his chair? Hang from the ceiling and make like a monkey?She tugged at the teacher's sleeve and spoke loudly in his ear. "Here I am, Mr. Herbifore."The teacher stared at her doubtfully. "Oh? Are you sure?" He looked puzzled. "Well, you're wanted in Dr. Leander's office."&nbsp;<br>Emmy knocked grumpily at Dr. Leander's door. She <i>hated</i> visiting the psychologist. She already had to sit there an hour every other week, just making up stuff for him to write in his blue notebook; why did she have to go <i>again</i>?The door opened. Emmy stepped back."Hello, dear," said Miss Barmy.The nanny had soft dark hair and green eyes, rimmed with gold like a cat's. Her lipstick was a slick pink, and when she smiled she showed a glimpse of perfectly even teeth, like a row of white chisels.Dr. Leander was gazing at her with open admiration. Men always did admire Miss Barmy; Emmy didn't know why.Maybe it was the odd cane she carried that everyone found so fascinating. Or maybe men thought she was pretty. Years ago, Emmy knew, Miss Barmy had won abeauty contest. But in spite of that, Emmy thought the nanny's face looked hard, as if all the makeup were a polished pink shell that no one could crack."Now then, Emmaline, Dr. Leander has kindly offered us the use of his conference room."The psychologist opened a side door with a grand gesture.Emmy sat down stiffly. "Have I done something wrong?"Miss Barmy brushed a fleck from her linen cuff. "Well, you <i>did</i> contradict me this morning about the time of your parents' arrival."Emmy frowned. Her parents' plane was supposed to land tomorrow evening at five thirty, she had been sure. But Miss Barmy had insisted the correc...</p><h2>The Force Awakens (Star Wars)</h2><p><b>#1 <i>NEW YORK TIMES</i> BESTSELLER �&nbsp;The official novelization of <i>Star Wars: The Force Awakens,</i> the blockbuster film directed by J.

Foster and his wife, JoAnn Oxley, live in Prescott, Arizona.Poe saw the saber come to life. Saw it start to describe its lethal arc. Time seemed to slow as he watched it descend. Thoughts raced through his mind, half crazed, wholly powerless. He heard himself yelling, sensed himself raising his blaster and firing. Too late, too slow, he told himself despondently even as he continued to fire. <br> &nbsp;<br> Perceiving the threat, Kylo Ren reacted immediately. A hand rose sharply, palm facing toward the unknown assailant. The gesture was merely the physical manifestation of something infinitely more powerful and entirely unseen. It intercepted the discharge from the pilot&#x2019;s weapon, freezing it in midair as effectively as any solid barrier. From behind the mask, eyes of preternatural intensity tracked the attack to its source. <br> &nbsp;<br> Initially driven by pure rage, Poe now found that he could not move. His heart pounded, his lungs heaved, but his voluntary muscles refused to respond. He was paralyzed as effectively as the blast from his blaster. <br> &nbsp;<br> A pair of stormtroopers took hold of him and dragged him for- ward until he stood helpless before the impassive Ren. Had they not held on to him, Poe would simply have fallen over. He attempted bravado even so. &#x201c;Who talks first?&#x201d; Poe asked, making his voice light. &#x201c;Do you talk first? Do I talk first?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Having deactivated his lightsaber and returned it to his belt, Lor San Tekka&#x2019;s murderer casually scrutinized the prisoner. Poe&#x2019;s nerves twanged as feeling slowly began to return to his arms and legs. Ren&#x2019;s gaze settled on the details of the pilot&#x2019;s clothing. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A Resistance pilot, by the looks of him.&#x201d; He nodded curtly. &#x201c;Search him. Thoroughly.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> One of the troopers who had dragged Poe forward commenced a detailed and none too gentle pat down. Pulling a small device from his service belt, the other trooper slowly passed it the length of the prisoner&#x2019;s body, beginning at the pilot&#x2019;s head and ending at his feet. The examination did not take long. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; declared the first stormtrooper, standing at attention. Poe winked up at the trooper who had used his hands. &#x201c;Good job.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;Forgetting himself for a moment, the goaded trooper kicked the prisoner&#x2019;s legs out from under him. Poe went down hard on his knees, still defiant. <br> &nbsp;<br> The other trooper gestured with the handheld instrument. &#x201c;Same here, sir. Internally, this one is clean. Nothing but the expected food residue.&#x201d; He didn&#x2019;t hesitate. &#x201c;Terminate him?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Kylo Ren did not let his disappointment show. At such times momentary delays were not unexpected. All would be satisfactorily resolved, in good time. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No. Keep him.&#x201d; A brief pause, then, &#x201c;Intact and functioning.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Plainly disappointed, the two troopers dragged Poe away. Ren watched them for a moment, contemplating possibilities. <i>Later</i>, he told himself. For now, there were other details to attend to. He allowed his thoughts to be briefly diverted, regretting the time that had been wasting in dealing with necessary inconsequentialities. <br> &nbsp;<br> Awaiting his pleasure, the senior officer in overall charge of the special squadrons drew herself up at his approach, her black cape of rank hanging loose around her. It stood in startling contrast to her armor, which even in the poor light shone like polished silver. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Your orders, sir?&#x201d; she murmured. <br> &nbsp;<br> Kylo Ren surveyed his blazing surroundings. He had already spent too much time here, to only partial satisfaction. He disliked such delays. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Kill them all, Captain Phasma, and search the village. Every building, every possible storage facility and place of concealment. When your troops have razed it to the ground, search the ground. Scanners, perceptors. You know what to look for.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> A single nod and she turned. A line of troopers stood before the assembled surviving villagers. &#x201c;On my command!&#x201d; Weapons were raised. The reactions of the villagers were typical. Some stepped forward, insolent to the last. Others fell to their knees. There was whimpering and crying and shouts of defiance. None of it lasted very long. <br> &nbsp;<br> <i>&#x201c;Fire!&#x201d; </i><br> &nbsp;<br> It wasn&#x2019;t a massacre. In the lexicon of the First Order it was nothing more than a prescribed chastisement. Appropriate retribution for harboring a fugitive of note. It was the nature of the tutorial that was important, not the numbers involved. It took less than a minute. <br> &nbsp;<br> When it was over, and the only sounds were methodical chatter among the troopers mixed with a variety of unholy crackling, they dispersed to carry out a final survey and scan of the debris&#x2014;inorganic and otherwise. Standing by himself, one trooper with a bloody face mask was startled when a hand came down on his shoulder. Though the hand belonged to a comrade, the first trooper did not relax. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Notice you didn&#x2019;t fire. Blaster jam?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Automatically, the trooper being questioned nodded in response. His comrade gestured knowingly and clapped him on the shoulder. &#x201c;Turn it in when we get back to base. Let the tech boys deal with it and get yourself a new one.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Thanks. I will.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> No sooner had his helpful colleague departed to rejoin his own unit than the trooper found himself gaping at the tall, dark-clad figure striding purposefully toward the singular shuttle that had set down in the midst of battle. Though he willed himself to move, to turn away, he found he could not. He remained rooted in place, clutching his unfired weapon, staring despite himself. <br> &nbsp;<br> And in response, the figure of Kylo Ren turned and looked sideways, directly at the soldier. The trooper saw only light reflecting off a mask, and his own fear. <br> &nbsp;<br> <i>He knows. He must know. And I&#x2019;m . . . dead</i>. <br> &nbsp;<br> But he wasn&#x2019;t. The glance lasted barely a second. Then Ren resumed his pace, deep in thought as he strode toward the shuttle. In the course of returning to his ship he passed a blaster lying on the ground. It was Poe&#x2019;s, the one that had come within an arm&#x2019;s length of killing him. Once he was beyond its reach he touched it&#x2014;but not with his hands. It rose, seemingly of its own accord, and flew free, smashing into a nearby structure and scaring the wits out of an idling stormtrooper unfortunate enough to be standing nearby. <br> &nbsp;<br> The purification of the village extended to its outskirts, where a clutch of troopers had just finished searching the damaged X-wing that had been abandoned there. Having done all they could with the tools and equipment at hand, they prepared to return to their units. Specialized gear could have reduced the Resistance fighter to its component parts, but that was not how they had been ordered to proceed. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Nothing there,&#x201d; declared the last of the quartet as he descended from the fighter&#x2019;s cockpit. &#x201c;The usual Resistance trash; that&#x2019;s all. Deep scan shows nothing in the fuselage or elsewhere.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> As soon as he was safely out of range, his companions activated the pair of heavy weapons they had brought to bear on the hiding place. A couple of bursts was all it took to reduce both ship and outcropping to rubble. <br> &nbsp;<br> The sound of the exploding X-wing reverberated across the gravel flats and dunes. Far away now, a solitary spherical droid looked back even as it continued to flee. The fireball that rose into the sky suggested the detonation of something far more volatile than primitive buildings and scrapped mechanicals. If he could have rolled faster, the frightened droid would have done so. <br> &nbsp;<br> Contrary to much popular thought, desert worlds are not quiet at night. In the absence of light, an entirely different ecology springs to life. Moving with greater caution, BB-8 tried not to pause at each howl, every <i>meep</i>, the sounds of clawed feet scraping against bare rock. There were things in the vacant, wild regions of underdeveloped planets that would gladly take apart a solitary droid just to see what made it tick. Or roll, he knew. His internal gyros threatened to send him tumbling wildly at the very thought of such an encounter. <br> &nbsp;<br> Droids such as him were not meant for unpopulated places, and he desperately desired to find others like himself. Or, failing that, even people. <br> &nbsp;<br> The shackles that Poe had worn on the troop transport were removed as soon as he and his captors disembarked. Aboard the Star Destroyer, there was no reason to physically restrain the prisoner. Apparently enjoying themselves, or perhaps merely impatient to get out of their armor, his escort chivvied him along with what he considered to be unnecessary roughness. Not that stormtroopers of any ilk were noted for their individual diplomacy. Considering whom he had tried to shoot, he knew he ought to consider himself fortunate that they had brought him aboard still attached to all his important appendages. <br> &nbsp;<br> A physical state of being, he knew, that could be altered at any moment. <br> &nbsp;<br> On the other side of the enormous and impressive receiving bay, other troopers were filing out, grateful that more of their number had not been lost on the expedition and looking forward to some rest and food. Intent on reliving the battle below, they paid no attention to one of their own who fell behind. When he was convinced no one was looking at him, the trooper turned and raced back into the open transport. He removed his helmet and proceeded to void the contents of his stomach into the nearest refuse receptacle. The terror in his expression was palpable. Fortunately, there was no one there to witness his disgrace. <br> &nbsp;<br> There was, however, now someone behind him. <br> &nbsp;<br> Terror gave way to cold fear as he found himself gazing back at Captain Phasma. How much had the senior officer seen? How much did she know? Too much, as it turned out.<br> &nbsp;<br> Aloof yet commanding, she indicated the rifle he still carried. &#x201c;FN-2187. I understand you experienced some difficulty with your weapon. Please be so good as to submit it for inspection by your division&#x2019;s technical team.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, Captain.&#x201d; How he managed to reply without stammering he did not know. Instinct as opposed to training, he decided. Self- preservation. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And who gave you permission to remove that helmet?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> He swallowed hard. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Captain.&#x201d;&nbsp;He could feel her disgust as he struggled to put the helmet back over his head. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Report to my division at once,&#x201d; Phasma said. Worse, he knew miserably, was likely to come later.</p><h2>The Question of Canon: Challenging the Status Quo in the New Testament Debate</h2><p><ul><li>2013 <em>Preaching</em> Survey of the Year's Best Books for Preachers</li><li><em>Preaching's</em> Preacher's Guide to the Best Bible Reference for 2014 (New Testament General)</li></ul> Did the New Testament canon arise naturally from within the early Christian faith? Were the books <em>written</em> as Scripture, or did they <em>become</em> Scripture by a decision of the second-century church? Why did early Christians have a canon at all? These are the types of questions that led Michael J. Kruger to pick apart modern scholarship?s dominant view that the New Testament is a late creation of the church imposed on books originally written for another purpose. Calling into question this commonly held "extrinsic" view, Kruger here tackles the five most prevalent objections to the classic understanding of a quickly emerging, self-authenticating collection of authoritative scriptures. Already a noted author on the subject of the New Testament canon, Kruger addresses foundational and paradigmatic assumptions of the extrinsic model as he provides powerful rebuttals and further support for the classic, "intrinsic" view. This framework recognizes the canon as the product of internal forces evolving out of the historical essence of Christianity, not a development retroactively imposed by the church upon books written hundreds of years before. Unlike many books written on the emergence of the New Testament canon that ask "when?" or "how?" Kruger focuses this work on the "why?"&#x2015;exposing weaknesses in the five major tenets of the extrinsic model as he goes. While <em>The Question of Canon</em> scrutinizes today?s popular scholastic view, it also offers an alternative concept to lay a better empirical foundation for biblical canon studies.</p><p>Michael J. Kruger (PhD, University of Edinburgh) is president and professor of New Testament at Reformed Theological Seminary in Charlotte, North Carolina. He is the author of several books, including <em>Canon Revisited: Establishing the Origins and Authority of the New Testament Books</em> and <em>The Heresy of Orthodoxy </em> (coauthored with Andreas K�stenberger). Together with Charles E. Hill he edited <em>The Early Text of the New Testament</em>."[T]his volume represents the kind of work [Kruger's] faculty should aspire to emulate. He takes the serious questions related to the canon head-on and helps the reader to work through these issues in order to gain a greater appreciation for and confidence in the canon as the correct shape of God's written Word." (R. Albert Mohler, The 2014 Preaching Survey of the Year's Best Books for Preachers, March/April 2014)<br><br>"Kruger has provided us with another useful and challenging contribution to this flourishing field of study. He rightly emphasizes giving greater weight to the historical reliability that the canon's development was early and natural, as well as not automatically adopting one model over and against all others. Students, pastors, and scholars alike will benefit greatly from this volume for years ahead." (Daniel J. Vitalo, Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society, June 2014)<br><br>"The book is a fascinating read which deals with a most important subject in a most helpful and scholarly way." (Evangelicals Now, March 2014)<br><br>"With an impressive familiarity with primary data and scholarly studies, and in a patient and generous tone toward other positions, Kruger makes a solid (to my mind, persuasive) case that the formation of a New Testament canon was a historical process with roots at least as early as the circulation and use of certain texts as scripture in the early second century. Offering what he calls an 'intrinsic model' as complement to the emphasis on the final stages of canon formation in much current scholarship, he presents a nuanced and cogent picture that more adequately captures the historical complexity that led to the New Testament." (Larry W. Hurtado, emeritus professor, University of Edinburgh)<br><br>"In this important book, Michael Kruger effectively challenges the common but unjustified conclusion that the canon was the late creation of the church, imposed on it by external forces. Kruger repeatedly points out the mistaken assumptions that underlie that conclusion, while on the positive side providing a more satisfactory understanding of the emergence of the canon within the church from virtually the beginning. The discussion is carried on in dialogue with the latest and best scholarship and reflects balanced and judicious wisdom throughout. If you are interested in the formation of the New Testament canon, you cannot afford to neglect this book." (Donald A. Hagner, George Eldon Ladd Professor Emeritus of New Testament, Fuller Theological Seminary)<br><br>"For decades the debate surrounding the NT's canonical status has been waged on a stage set with all-too-familiar props and lights. An emerging expert on issues of canon, Michael Kruger brings fresh direction to a well-known script by questioning old assumptive props and setting the main actors under a new light. This is exactly the kind of fresh scholarship we need to go forward." (Nicholas Perrin, Franklin S. Dyrness Chair of Biblical Studies, Wheaton College Graduate School)<br><br>"Already the author of one important book on the formation of the New Testament canon, Kruger here tackles the five most prevalent objections to the classic, Christian understanding of a quickly emerging, self-authenticating collection of authoritative counterparts to the Hebrew Scriptures. Not only does he directly address these objections, he provides powerful rebuttals and further support for the classic view. All who insist on maintaining the (more liberal) scholarly consensus will have to refute Kruger if they are to maintain any credibility on this topic!" (Craig L. Blomberg, Distinguished Professor of New Testament, Denver Seminary)<br><br>"The regnant view of NT canon formation in academic circles holds that the canon is a late ecclesiastical creation, and one that is far removed from the mindset of Jesus, his apostles and even the church for at least the first century and a half of its existence. Kruger takes five major planks on which this view is built, subjects them to historical scrutiny, and, where there are any solid splinters of truth left after inspection, shows how they may be incorporated into a better empirical foundation for canon studies. This important study argues that an 'intrinsic' model for canon, which recognizes the canon as the product of internal forces evolving out of the historical essence of Christianity, is superior to the 'extrinsic' model that has dominated canon studies for too long. May this book find many readers." (Charles E. Hill, professor of New Testament, Reformed Theological Seminary Orlando, and coauthor of The Early Text of the New Testament)<br><br>"I found it a fascinating, well-balanced and worthwhile read." (Margaret Baxter, The Reader, Summer 2014)<br><br>"The issue of how and why the biblical canon was set in the early church continues to be a strong and important discussion in contemporary biblical and theological scholarship. This book is a very helpful voice in that debate. Kruger describes the sides of the debate as those who see the canon shaped by 'extrinsic' factors&#x2015;that is, outside forces such as the decisions of church or imperial leaders or reactions to heretical views&#x2015;or 'intrinsic' factors such as the model provided by Judaism, the circulation and reception of these sacred texts by the early Christian community, and the apostolic authority of the texts themselves."

But when her family moved to New York during the radical sixties, she became intoxicated by the promise of social change. By the time she turned twenty-one, Alice had a new name -- Afeni Shakur, derived from the Yoruba term for "lover of people" -- and a new vision for the future. The rest is history. <br> In 1969, Afeni was arrested along with other members of the Black Panther party on 189 felony charges that included 30 counts of conspiracy. Though she was eventually acquitted of the charges, Afeni spent eleven months in jail before being released. Once on bail, she became pregnant with a son: Tupac Amaru Shakur, a rap megastar until his tragic death in 1996. <br> In this searing work, renowned actress and Afeni's trusted friend Jasmine Guy reveals the evolution of a woman through a series of intimate conversations on themes such as love, death, race, drugs, politics, music, and of course her son. Filled with startling revelations and heartbreaking truths, Afeni's memoir is a powerful testament to the human spirit and the perseverance of the African American people.</p><p><b>Jasmine Guy</b> has known Afeni Shakur for nearly a decade, having met her via Afeni's son, Tupac. A multitalented performer, Guy began her career as a dancer for the Alvin Ailey American Dance Center. She moved to acting and television, however, with the starring role of Whitley Gilbert on the hit series <i>A Different World.</i> During the show's six-season run, Jasmine made her film debut in Spike Lee's <i>School Daze</i> and went on to costar in Eddie Murphy's <i>Harlem Nights.</i> Her other big and small screen credits include <i>Kla$h, Diamond Men, Stompin' at the Savoy, Any Day Now, Linc's, Feast of All Saints,</i> and her current role as Roxie in the Showtime series <i>Dead Like Me.</i> Jasmine is married with one child. This is her first book.<p><b>Chapter ONE: The Stuff</b> </p><p> "<i>It's important to know the stuff you came from</i>." </p><p> -- Afeni Shakur </p><p><br> I travel east on I-20 as the sun sets behind me, passing exits I no longer recognize. Old fears of being lost on the highway in Stone Mountain, Georgia, resurface, even though I'm told it's no longer the crackerland of my childhood. Black folk live out here now, far beyond the parameters of my youth. Today, Atlanta stretches past Cumberland Mall, Six Flags, and even Stone Mountain. Things have changed and I missed the transition. I feel strangely stuck right in the middle of my life. There was a time when my life was <i>all</i> ahead of me. Today, there is a big chunk behind me and maybe just as much in front. All this means is, I still have time to change my attitudes and sensibilities, but I am just less inclined to do so. Let's say I'm just a little less flexible. Like an uncle of mine who still says "colored" instead of "black." He just never got used to saying "Black" or "Negro," and didn't understand what difference it made or why he had to make a change. The change was irrelevant to him..."African-American" was out of the question. </p><p> So, the irony of the famed revolutionary and impassioned mother of a rapper -- superstar Tupac Shakur -- now residing in suburban, once-Klan-country Georgia is not lost on me. In fact, I have learned to expect the unexpected from Afeni Shakur. Not because she means to be complex or contradictory, but because she just is. That is her truth, and it's a truth that fascinates me. I've grown to love my friend Afeni. </p><p> As I drive I think back to December 1, 1994, the day I met Afeni. At the time, I was writing a screenplay about a fictitious young woman in the '60s who was raising her daughter while still living with her own mother. The piece was, or still is if I ever get finished writing it, a three-generation piece about Black women. The young woman in the middle is a fictitious, composite character of Angela Davis and Afeni Shakur. My plan was to meet Afeni and hopefully have her help me develop this particular character and perhaps give me her insights on the other two. </p><p> The way I met her was not how I'd imagined, though. In fact, I was thrust into a tumultuous family trauma her son, my friend, Tupac, had been brutally shot five times in the foyer of a New York recording studio on a Sunday night; had left Bellevue Hospital on a Monday, and was in court on a Tuesday morning for a sexual assault hearing. So, on December 1, 1994, I was early for the court hearing and waiting in a vast hallway with Jada Pinkett, a close friend of mine and an even closer friend to Tupac Shakur. We were waiting to get a glimpse of Tupac on his way into court and let him know we were near and there for him. At that time, I didn't even know the charges or the circumstances of the trial. I just knew that Tupac was shot the night before in the entrance of the recording studio, and I needed to be there to support my friends -- Jada and Tupac. </p><p> The crazy events of the last two days had me reeling, but I tried to consciously stay in the moment. <i>It is Tuesday morning. Tuesday morning. You're in New York. You're at the courthouse.</i> I remember talking myself into the present moment of that day, but I kept slipping out. <i>Tupac is shot. Someone shot Tupac.</i> Today is Tuesday morning...<i>Five times! Who did it? He's at Bellevue</i>....That was Monday, which would be yesterday....<i>He's out. Tupac's gone. He left. The hospital? He didn't feel safe up in there. At Bellevue? Monday, that was yesterday. Where is he? I don't know, but I'm going to New York</i>. Here I am Tuesday morning at the courthouse. <i>Just be here. Just be present. Someone may need you.</i> </p><p> And that's where I was -- jumping back and forth in my head -- this Monday, the day I first saw Afeni Shakur. A tight group clustered at the end of the hall, surrounding a wheelchair holding an ashen, bandaged, diminutive Tupac. Two women headed the clan that hovered over him, and I later learned that his family was indeed a "clan." At the time, however, it just looked to me like a bunch of <i>folk</i>. I mistook the lady in charge to be Afeni at first notice, but the lady was Glo, Afeni's sister. Afeni stood beside her. Glo was stern and serious, as I had imagined Afeni would be, and Glo checked me out when she first saw me, like I was some little wannabee trying to get next to Tupac. Afeni, on the other hand, was warmer. She embraced me like I was an old friend. Little did I know I would grow to be just that -- an old friend. </p><p> I sit with this memory of December 1994 when I first met Afeni. I sit with this memory now in Stone Mountain, Georgia, as I approach the long driveway of Afeni's house -- the house Tupac bought for her. Eight years later, I get to sit with my Afeni, and I relish my time alone in her world. She wants to talk of origins, beginnings. She is ready now to reveal her own history. She is ready now because she's taken some time with herself to reflect on her life. She needed this time because her beloved son died. He didn't die the first time he was shot five times in the foyer of the New York recording studio, but he was shot again two years later in Las Vegas. And this time, she lost him. September 13, 1996. So, Afeni needed some time to look at her life and work out why she is still here. Now, she wants to tell <i>her</i> story, and she called me to tell it to. She says she's been back to her home and has spent some time with her people. She understands more about her mama, her daddy, and their mamas and daddies. She's had some time to go back home to Lumberton, North Carolina, and Norfolk, Virginia, and revisit where her life began as Alice Faye Williams. </p><p><br> Her house is set back from the street. I park next to a few cars in the driveway, and I recognize one of them as Tupac's prized Mercedes. I smile and walk up the steps to Afeni's front door. It is ajar, so, I just step in and yell a few "hellos." </p><p> "I'm in the back," Afeni calls. </p><p> I follow her voice through the airy living room and wood-paneled den. On the walls are powerful oil portraits of Tupac. The photos on the mantel above the brick fireplace celebrate Afeni's babies, her grandchildren, nieces, nephews, grandnieces, grandnephews, and the offspring of her ex-comrades and their children's children. A generation has passed since the revolution. My baby, Imani, is up there too. And I realize I am part of this family as well, and I'm grateful for the inclusion. </p><p> I reach Afeni's bedroom only to find her backlit in the doorway of her veranda, her silhouetted arms reaching out to me. I get closer and I see her glistening eyes smile broadly. She hugs me, strong and hearty, as if she were a big ole man instead of the small-boned little lady she is. I enjoy Afeni's hug. It carries weight and time and the sense that it may be the last one. So I hold on tight. There aren't many people in my life this happy to see me and she always is. </p><p> "Afeni," I say. "I can't believe your house. It's so warm and inviting and -- " </p><p> "I got furniture," she proclaims. </p><p> We laugh and I add, "I didn't crawl over lumps of sleeping teenagers on the floor either. And it's light in here. And clear." </p><p> "Yeah," Afeni says. "I only smoke back here now, in my room and on my porch. 'Cause of the kids, you know." </p><p> "It's lovely, Fe. I'm proud of you." Having a house that is a home is a major accomplishment for Afeni, who has spent most of her adult life an impoverished gypsy. In dire straits she always stayed with her sister Glo, and dire straits were frequent. </p><p> "Come on out here." Afeni leads the way. "Come on out here on my porch." </p><p> The porch is deep and long, and wraps around the house like a huge knitted scarf. In one corner, Afeni's chaise lounge sits to the right of a small table. Another cushioned chair to the left of the small table faces the sprawling pine forest of her backyard. In the farthest corner a large color TV flickers, on mute, but full of CNN. </p><p> "Shit, you might as well move the bed out here, too," I exclaim. I've never seen a TV on an outdoor porch before. I nestle in my chair and let the warm, rich Georgia air rest on my face. God, I miss humidity. </p><p> "This is all I ever wanted," Afeni says. "This right here? This is the best thing Tupac ever did for me." </p><p> "It is nice, Afeni, and very peaceful." I began to see why she's in Stone Mountain. </p><p> "Land. We always wanted land. Shit, I come from sharecroppers. Of course, they wanted land, too. They understood the value of <i>owning</i> your own land, 'cause they never owned nothing. My great-grandmother, Millie Ann, she was the last person in our family to have land, and it has taken all this time for us to own land again Now, Black people want trinkets, cars and clothes, and shit. That's part of the genocide, the loss of values. It is killing us, as a people." </p><p> Afeni shakes her head. "Millie Ann had land, and she lost it. Her sons got busted, and she put the house up for bail. Then it burned down. Black people had land, you know, but we lost it. It was hard to keep it, though, but when that land got taken, it broke us down a little more. So, the next time the children came up, they didn't know it is the <i>land</i> that is important. Now, they think the trinket is important 'cause their parents and their parents before them didn't own shit." </p><p> "And they died owning nothing," I add. </p><p> "And nothing to pass down," Afeni says. </p><p> "The Cadillac parked in front of unit B in the projects," I say to Afeni, the vision dear to me. Having grown up near a project in Atlanta, I get what she's saying about our skewed values. </p><p> "Exactly, but if you got your land, that's what you work for. I don't need no clothes, jewelry, and shit. Because now I work to keep the land. I want a generator in case the electricity goes out. I want space so if someone needs a place to live, they can put a trailer up right there and have a home. I want my grandchildren to know how to garden and cultivate their own food. I want them to know because I come from farmers and people of the land and I lost it. You see that," Afeni points to a patch of dark soil with cabbage, lettuce, carrots thriving. "I tried to do that garden and I got calluses and shit. I burned my hands up! That shit is hard work. Them women in those days, my great-grandmother, my people, they worked their butts off from sunup to sundown to keep it up. You can't be spending your money on trinkets if you have to keep up your land." </p><p> I join in. "When I first got <i>A Different World</i> I bought a house. Actually, I did a Burger King commercial for sixty grand, and that was my down payment. Before I bought a nice car or a nice stereo system, I made sure I had a home that I owned." </p><p> Afeni taps my thigh. "Yes," she says excitedly. "Priority. And I'm glad your people taught you that. You knew early. It's taken me so many years to find my priority in life, only to come right back here where I began. Now, I know what I'm working for and striving for. The real estate man who showed me this place was happy to sell it to me, you know, until he found out who my son was. Then he wanted me to go and get a big ole fancy house." </p><p> "Yes, 'cause your son's a superstar! You need some marble and a fountain, some gates and some statues, a swimming pool!" I laugh because such showy opulence would be untrue to Afeni's real self. </p><p> "And I wanted the <i>land</i>, not the house. The land, to live on and to cultivate and pass on to my family." </p><p> Afeni inhales her Newport and surveys the deep forest green of her backyard. I notice new saplings planted on the edge of her small pine forest. </p><p> "Those new trees are what the babies planted," Afeni says proudly. </p><p> Afeni's "babies" are the Shakur family's next generation. The two sisters, Glo and Afeni, are at the helm -- they are the keepers of the brood. Sekyiwa, Afeni's daughter, and Tupac's sister, has two children -- Nzingha and Malik. Jamala, Glo's daughter, has one daughter -- Imani. Katari, Glo's son, has a daughter as well, Kyira, the same name as my daughter. And on any given day, these cousins roam Afeni's yard, raid her refrigerator, and laugh up the rooms of her Stone Mountain refuge. </p><p> "Nzingha wanted a pine tree. So, that's her tree right there. That one is Imani's. And Leeki [Malik], he wanted a fruit-bearing tree. This one's his and look...there's some fruit! We plant a tree for Tupac on his birthday every year. Either here or on the farm." </p><p> Afeni also owns a 56-acre farm in Lumberton, North Carolina. She invites me to go there often, but I'm reluctant to travel too far from my double-tall, two-sugar-in-the-raw nonfat lattes. </p><p> "You got to come, Jasmine," Afeni insists. "Bring the children. Children love it. I got cows and pigs. We grow our own vegetables -- organic vegetables, without those chemicals and hormones that are killing our kids. We give away these clean vegetables to the people of Robeson County. They work the land, and they sell the produce. It's for them and by them." Afeni gets excited. "You see, Lumberton is the poorest county in North Carolina. Robeson County -- the poorest. And what this means is..." </p><p> Afeni looks nothing like she did when I first met her in the halls of the courthouse doting over her bandaged son. Then, she was reticent, kind of caved in. She looked sad and tired, worried and scared. She was skinny then, too, maybe one hundred pounds and some change. Now, when I look at her beaming over her newly planted trees, her skin has some red in it, and her head is full of new thick hair -- short and healthy without the patches of distress that once wore through. </p><p> "I've got some Lumbees helping me with my land," Afeni continues. "They come every day and work the land." </p><p> "What's a Lumbi?" I picture little gnomelike creatures with green skin and snakelike tails that only till the land at night. </p><p> "Lumbee's are Indians indigenous to that part of North Carolina." </p><p> "Lumbee. Never heard of them. But isn't that Cherokee country?" </p><p> "No, the Lumbee Indian came from the Sioux and Cheraw. They mixed with some Spanish explorers early on. Then, you know, the English and Scottish came and they mixed with them, too. By that time, they started to lose their language and their customs and nobody knew what to call them. They were all mixed up." </p><p> "They spoke English?" </p><p> "Yes," Afeni is emphatic. "I'm telling you, they lost their culture and their language but they stayed separate. They knew they were Indians. They just needed a name. First they were Croatan Indians. Then they were Robeson County Indians. Then, the Cherokee of Robeson County. They've been called a lot of names. Lumbee came after a long fight to be recognized by the North Carolina legislature as a tribe. They named themselves after the Lumbee River." </p><p> Afeni takes a long drink of water, grabs her pack of Newports and continues. "I thought my great-grandmother married a Lumbee. Well, at least part Lumbee, part white dude, but he was just a white dude, really poor white trash." </p><p> "Was this your great-grandmother's second marriage?" </p><p> "No. This was her first." </p><p> "Then, this is your gre...</p></p><h2>The Resilience Breakthrough: 27 Tools for Turning Adversity into Action</h2><p><b>A Guide to Resilience: How to Bounce Back from Life's Inevitable Problems</b> <p> Christian Moore is convinced that each of us has a power hidden within, something that can get us through any kind of adversity.

In <i>The Latinos of Asia</i>, Anthony Christian Ocampo shows that what "color" you are depends largely on your social context. Filipino Americans, for example, helped establish the Asian American movement and are classified by the U.S. Census as Asian. But the legacy of Spanish colonialism in the Philippines means that they share many cultural characteristics with Latinos, such as last names, religion, and language. Thus, Filipinos' "color"&#x2015;their sense of connection with other racial groups&#x2015;changes depending on their social context. </p> <p>The Filipino story demonstrates how immigration is changing the way people negotiate race, particularly in cities like Los Angeles where Latinos and Asians now constitute a collective majority. Amplifying their voices, Ocampo illustrates how second-generation Filipino Americans' racial identities change depending on the communities they grow up in, the schools they attend, and the people they befriend. Ultimately, <i>The Latinos of Asia</i> offers a window into both the racial consciousness of everyday people and the changing racial landscape of American society.</p></p><p><b>Anthony Christian Ocampo</b> is Assistant Professor of Sociology at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona and a Ford Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow at the School of Public Policy at University of California-Riverside."Engaging and timely, <i>The Latinos of Asia</i> shatters static, homogenizing, and binary categorizations of Asian Americans and Latinas/os. Presenting powerful testimonials by Filipinos from two Los Angeles communities and centering dynamics in schools and neighborhoods, this must-read book complicates understandings of race, identity, and Los Angeles." (Gilda L. Ochoa <i>Author of <i>Academic Profiling: Latinos, Asian Americans and the Achievement Gap</i></i>)<br><br>"<i>The Latinos of Asia</i> is essential reading for those interested in understanding the complexity of American race relations. The beautifully written accounts reveal how Filipinos struggle with the role of race and place in America and the implications of this struggle for how they create life goals, choose whom to love, and decide whom they will befriend. Weaving together different stories, Ocampo expertly shows that, by questioning and accepting panethnicity, Filipinos break and remake the rules of race." (G. Cristina Mora <i><i>American Journal of Sociology</i></i>)<br><br>"<i>The Latinos of Asia</i> is groundbreaking. Ocampo examines racial identities among Filipino Americans not just in relation to whites, but in relation to other minorities. Through candid and eloquent responses from Filipino American young adults, and engaging links to scholarly discussions, Ocampo tracks the fluidity of race and argues that place matters in how people come to think about themselves." (Robyn Rodriguez <i>UC Davis</i>)<br><br>"This is a groundbreaking book about one of the least understood groups of people: Filipinos. As a people, we're a lot American, we're definitely Asian, and we're undeniably Latino. <i>The Latinos of Asia</i> is essential reading not only for the Filipino diaspora but for anyone who cares about the mysteries of racial identity." (Jose Antonio Vargas <i>Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and founder of Define American and #EmergingUS</i>)<br><br>"<i>The Latinos of Asia</i> presents an innovative analysis of Filipinos as an 'in-between' people straddling the stigmatized immigrant groups from Latin America and model minority newcomer populations from Asia. This book convincingly demonstrates that race is not a fixed characteristic of individuals and groups. Anthony Ocampo's work will capture the imagination of students of immigration, race, and ethnicity alike." (Rub�n Hern�ndez-Le�n <i>Associate Professor of Sociology and Director of the UCLA Center for Mexican Studies</i>)<br><br>"Analyzing Filipino American experiences of 'looking Asian but having a Spanish last name' or 'looking Mexican but identifying as Asian,' Ocampo shows how the children of Filipino immigrants constantly challenge the prevailing racial mapping rules in America. <i>The Latinos of Asia</i> is groundbreaking, offering an ingenious perspective on racial dynamics and formation." (Min Zhou <i>Tan Lark Sye Chair Professor of Sociology, Nanyang Technological University, and co-Author of <i>The Asian American Achievement Paradox</i></i>)<br><br>"<i>The Latinos of Asia</i> is an important contribution to the field of sociology and social science understandings of Filipinos in the United States. Although Ocampo's findings may be unique to Filipinos in the Los Angeles area, his work pushes open the door for more sociological research to examine Filipinos in the United States." (Daniel B. Eisen <i><i>Ethnic and Racial Studies</i></i>)<br><br>"Are Filipino Americans Asian, Latino, or something else entirely? In this provocative book, Anthony Ocampo deftly combines survey analysis, in-depth interviews, and personal narrative to show that the answer is not a simple one. It depends critically on context and has important implications for matters such as life chances, life choices, and race relations in a rapidly diversifying nation." (Karthick Ramakrishnan, Professor and Associate Dean of Public Policy <i>University of California Riverside</i>)<br><br>"Anthony Ocampo's fascinating study illustrates how Filipinos do not fit neatly into American racial categories. His highly accessible narrative carries the reader through different social and institutional contexts that draw Filipinos back and forth over panethnic lines, and challenge our notion of what panethnicity means in America." (Wendy Roth, Associate Professor of Sociology <i>The University of British Columbia</i>)<br><br>"Anthony Ocampo shows that understanding race in today's America means understanding a group that toes different racial lines: Filipino Americans. Through rich interviews and accessible prose, Ocampo explains how Filipino Americans straddle Latino and Asian racial categories, and what that straddling says about race in the United States today. This is <i>the</i> definitive account of the contemporary Filipino American experience." (Tom�s R.

A capo in the notorious Bonanno family�a deadly martial artist highly skilled with knives and other lethal weapons�Pitera murdered his way to becoming one of the premier assassins in the New York mafia during the 1980s. He didn�t just whack people; he diabolically made them disappear forever. In hushed whispers people spoke of Pitera�s secret burial grounds and the grotesque things he did to his victim�s bodies. If the Mafia had a Jeffrey Dahmer, it was surely Tommy Pitera.</p> <p> Offering the first-ever look at the life and crimes of Tommy Pitera, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Philip Carlo exposes the man behind some of the most horrific murders in Mafia history�and tells the story of the heroic investigator who brought him down. Cloaked in the bloody history of La Cosa Nostra, <i>The Butcher</i> is Carlo�s most frightening portrayal yet of the depraved depths within a psychopath�s mind.</p></p><p><p>Philip Carlo was born and raised on the mean streets of Bensonhurst, Brooklyn&#x2014;the same streets Tommy Pitera hailed from. There, Carlo earned a Ph.D. in street smarts, and he escaped a life of crime by writing about it with unusual insight. He is the author of the bestsellers <em>The Night Stalker</em>, about notorious serial killer Richard Ramirez, and <em>The Ice Man</em>, about infamous Mafia contract killer Richard Kuklinski. Carlo lives with his wife, Laura, in New York City.</p>A veteran chronicler of the mafiosi, Carlo (<i>The Ice Man</i>) turns his attention to Tommy Karate Pitera, a brutal capo in the Bonanno crime family who allegedly killed 60 people. Carlo traces the rise of Pitera, born in 1954 into a modest Brooklyn family, to an honored place with the Bonannos, whose reputation for widespread drug peddling and bloody rubouts struck fear in their rivals. After spending two years in Japan, Pitera returned home with mastery in martial arts, efficiency in killing and a love for drama, often dressing as a rabbi, a woman or in other wacky disguises to score a hit. The other fascinating character of this gangster saga is Jim Hunt, a tough DEA officer, who assembles a dragnet of smart methods, snitches and turncoats, and snares Pitera and his crew after several savage murders. Carlo's scalding depiction of this mob mad man is enhanced by 16 unpublished photos not seen by <i>PW</i>, but apparently so gruesome Carlo feels compelled to warn readers in an author's note. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It was the slap in the face I needed to just STOP AND PUT THE PHONE DOWN. I had no sense of dignity when he broke up with me. I was only worried about satisfying my need to communicate with him, and completely forgot how HE viewed my actions. How he was judging my desperation. If you've lost common sense over someone and don't know how to step back, THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU.EMPOWERINGAfter reading this book, I instantly felt empowered. Why should I be crying over my ex or praying he will reconcile? He's lucky I even dated him in the first place. This book pointed out so many of his flaws. I don't even want him back now. On to a real man, please!AWESOME ADVICEThis book sucked me in and made me realize I did everything wrong! Everything! I begged I pleaded, I cried, I texted and texted about how I felt. The whole time he sat back and relaxed and ignored me or gave me a two-word response. Not anymore. After reading this book and looking back, I'm not even sure I want him back in my life now! That is how good this book is. I had standards before him, and now I have standards again! Going to read it over and over to remind myself of who I am and that I deserve someone that wants me, not wants me to belittle myself. Definitely a great read for those sitting and crying!</p><p>Leslie Braswell is a best-selling author who loves to empower women with knowledge when it comes to matters of the heart.

It unifies Presbyterians who use it as one of their church standards. It gives us all Christians the meat of the Word of God. It places a greater emphasis on, and gives fuller explanations of, doctrines that maturing Christians need to hear. It emphasizes aspects of the gospel and draws directly from Scripture in a way that other catechisms do not. And the Larger Catechism emphasizes the church, the ministry, preaching, and the sacraments at a time when all Christians&#x2014;need to hear of them. Spurgeon, a Baptist, found the use of the Westminster Catechisms of tremendous value, even drawing from them in forming a catechism of his own. He extolled their use in the family as a valuable tool in discipling our children. This edition is newly typeset in larger-print and in a large 8.5" x 11" format with wider margins, lending itself to study. It is complete with all full Scripture proof texts supporting each question and its answer.</p><p></p><h2>Stick Dog Gets the Tacos (Stick Dog, 9)</h2><p><p><strong>Perfect for fans of Big Nate, Diary of a Wimpy Kid, and the previous Stick Dog books, Tom Watson&#x2019;s hilarious series continues with a backyard adventure complete with crunchy tacos, squishy guacamole, and flying unicorns!</strong></p><p><strong><em>HEY!

He also has a dog, as you could probably guess. The dog is a Labrador-Newfoundland mix. Tom says he looks like a Labrador with a bad perm. He wanted to name the dog "Put Your Shirt On" (please don't ask why), but he was outvoted by his family. The dog's name is Shadow. Early in his career Tom worked in politics, including a stint as the chief speechwriter for the governor of Ohio. This experience helped him develop the unique, storytelling narrative style of the Stick Dog books. More important, Tom's time in politics made him realize a very important thing: Kids are way smarter than adults. And it's a lot more fun and rewarding to write stories for them than to write speeches for grown-ups.</p></p><h2>Sell It Like Serhant: How to Sell More, Earn More, and Become the Ultimate Sales Machine</h2><p><b>NATIONAL BESTSELLER<i> ** USA Today </i>Bestseller<i> </i>**<i> Los Angeles Times </i>Bestseller ** <i>Wall Street Journal </i>Bestseller</b><br><b><br></b><b>A lively and practical guide on how to sell anything and achieve long-term success in business</b><br>Ryan Serhant was a shy, jobless hand model when he entered the real estate business in 2008 at a time the country was on the verge of economic collapse.

What is its true nature--good or evil? And are there others out there like him?<br></p></p><p>Writing this book was a pure joy. &nbsp;It was a return for me to gothic motifs --- the old dark house, &nbsp;a mysterious death, the promise of family secrets, and <i>the supernatural monster as hero -- </i>that I had used in the Vampire Chronicles, and the Tales of the Mayfair Witches. &nbsp;And once again, &nbsp;I felt compelled to create an origin story and a cosmology --- this time for my protagonist, Reuben Golding, who finds himself periodically turning into the werewolf of legend. &nbsp;Only unlike the doomed werewolves of so many popular films, Reuben retains full awareness during the transformation and a keen enjoyment of his immense wolfen powers. &nbsp;He never becomes a four footed animal, but remains a deeply conflicted, fierce but compassionate beast-man, &nbsp;hungry for power, and for answers as to the mystery of what he has become. &nbsp;Though similar in many ways to my vampires novels, &nbsp;Reuben's story is almost entirely contemporary. &nbsp;And for the first time in my writing career I explored the haunted atmosphere of California's cold, mist shrouded redwood forests, and the romance of the windswept northern California coast. &nbsp;I lived in northern California for over thirty years, and it was a great pleasure to get back to it, to have my hero dining in San Francisco's North Beach, or meeting his lady love in the quaint town of Mill Valley for breakfast, or driving his sports car north on Highway 101 as he pushes deeper into a grim but at times glorious adventure. &nbsp;------ I've been asked: will this be a series? I don't know. &nbsp;I held nothing back in the writing of <i>The Wolf Gift,</i> but the characters are alive in my imagination, as vividly as any I've ever created, and I see the grand house of Nideck Point looming against a leaden sky, beckoning me just as it beckoned my hero, Reuben.<b>Anne Rice</b> is the author of thirty-one books.

Jews also comprise a very large number of history&#x2019;s most important figures, people who have had a profound impact on humanity. Approximately 35% of Nobel Prizes have been awarded to Jews. No other ethnic group has even come close to matching the abilities and accomplishments of Jews. <br><br>Since such a large percent of the wealthiest and most successful people in the world are Jewish, a common question the world over is, &#x201c;Why are so many Jews so wealthy?&#x201d; Their secret lies not in their genetics or intelligence, as some have believed, but in their religion. Many of the wealthiest Jews use a code based on Judaism. <br><br>You do not need to convert to Judaism or believe in religion to use The Money Code. &#x201c;Religion has preserved history's greatest wisdom teachings,&#x201d; says religious studies scholar Huston Cummings Smith. <br><br>There are various methods of wealth creation; however, many are short-lived, unfulfilling, or hazardous. The ideal circumstance is to create long-lasting wealth, accompanied by peace of mind and fulfilment. This book will reveal the code that many Jews understand and use to their great advantage. The Money Code can be used by absolutely anyone to achieve long-term wealth and success in life.</p><p></p><h2>Zondervan Illustrated Bible Dictionary (Premier Reference Series)</h2><p><p>The Zondervan Illustrated Bible Dictionary provides a visually stimulating journey for anyone interested in learning more about the world of the Bible.

However, the aura of Ferrari does indeed approach the miraculous. What lies behind this phenomenon? What is the source of fascination for a brand whose creative designs are internationally recognized and enthusiastically received? First, even today--70 years after the company was founded--the miracle of Ferrari is still due in large part to the personality of Il Commendatore, Enzo Ferrari. Patience, passion, and being hard on himself and those around him gave the brand, under the emblem of the Cavallino Rampante, the power to become what it is today: sheer fascination on four wheels. Second, the long list of international racing victories is equally important. There is no class, no competition, that Ferrari did not set its sights on and win more or less immediately during the company&#39;s last 70 years. Finally, Ferrari is synonymous with aesthetics, elegance, and trend-setting design. The true value of a brand and its products is measured in the currency of impassioned devotion. This is the third and perhaps most vital element confirming the Ferrari miracle: The Ferrari Book - Passion for Design traces the evolution of the miracle and lets us experience passion given automotive form in a large and engrossing format.</p><p>Based on expertise and the single-minded pursuit of a theme over several decades, and with the resources of cars and culture magazine, ramp, a team of authors working with editor-in-chief MICHAEL K�CKRITZ developed a novel idea for a series: In The Ultimate Ferrari Book, Ferrari enthusiasts will find 40 spectacular icons, all of them selected for their design. Describing the core elements of the contemporary craze for Ferrari and automobiles, in general, this book is a new and different treat for all ultimate fans.<br><br></p><h2>What You Accept is What You Teach: Setting Standards for Employee Accountability</h2><p>While everyone is accountable for their own behavior, leaders are ultimately responsible for employee performance.

He read the 18th century spiritual writings of St. Louis-Marie Grignion de Montfort and prayed St. Louis' thirty-three days of preparation for total consecration to Jesus through Mary. He understood anew that the purpose of a true devotion to Mary is to be directed into a deeper relationship with Jesus and the Holy Trinity. The consecration so marked his life that he would adopt St. Louis' phrase Totus Tuus (Latin for "Totally Yours") as his motto as bishop and later as pope.</p><p>Blessed John Paul II's adoption of this radical commitment to Jesus through Mary ignited a new flame in the hearts of countless Catholics all over the world.</p><p>This fresh look at Marian consecration takes the themes and structures of St. Louis de Montfort's preparation for total consecration and incorporates the teachings and insight of Blessed John Paul II, including prayer, contemplation, and resolutions that will open your heart to the life of the Holy Trinity. Through these thirty-three days of spiritual exercises you will discover how you can grow closer to Jesus through the heart of Mary, while becoming the very best version of yourself in a life of consecration.</p></p><p></p><h2>Body, Mind, and Spirit: Daily Meditations (Hazelden Meditations)</h2><p><b>Written with warmth and understanding, this daily meditation book for those in recovery offers thoughtful and supportive advice for healing the whole person--body, mind, and spirit.</b><br><br>We are more than our addictions.

Pregnant and traveling alone, this woman, like so many coolies, disappeared into history.&nbsp;In&nbsp;<i>Coolie Woman,&nbsp;</i>her great-granddaughter Gaiutra Bahadur embarks on a journey into the past to find her.&nbsp;Traversing three continents and trawling through countless colonial archives, Bahadur excavates not only her great-grandmother's story but also the repressed history of some quarter of a million other coolie women, shining a light on their complex lives.<br> Shunned by society, and sometimes in mortal danger, many coolie women were either runaways, widows, or outcasts. Many of them left husbands and families behind to migrate alone in epic sea voyages&#x2015;traumatic "middle passages"&#x2015;only to face a life of hard labor, dismal living conditions and sexual exploitation.&nbsp;<i>Coolie Woman</i>&nbsp;is a meditation on survival, a gripping story of a double diaspora&#x2015;from India to the West Indies in one century, Guyana to the United States in the next&#x2015;that is at once a search for one's roots and an exploration of gender and power, peril and opportunity.&nbsp;</p><p>"An astonishing document--both a historical rescue mission and a profound meditation on family and womanhood, Gaiutra Bahadur's&nbsp;<i>Coolie Woman</i>&nbsp;spans continents and centuries, the private and the national, to bring to light the extraordinary lives of the author's great-grandmother and the other quarter of a million 'coolie' women that came to the New World as indentured laborers." ---&nbsp;<b>Junot Diaz</b>, author of <i>This Is How You Lose Her</i> "Gaiutra Bahadur's pathbreaking book carefully excavates an imperial history of violence and uprooting. But this is no simple account of victimhood. It shows, with understated literary power, the bitterly paradoxical nature of colonial modernity: the unbearable dialectic between enslavement and liberation that many unsung millions underwent in their private lives." ---&nbsp;<b>Pankaj Mishra</b>, author of&nbsp;<i>From the Ruins of Empire&nbsp;</i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i>"Gaiutra Bahadur's book made me realize how the experience of a whole generation of women like her great-grandmother profoundly challenges the various stereotypes we have.

Yet with so many students and big concepts to cover, it can be hard to slow down enough to look for those moments when students&#x2019; responses tell us what we need to know about next best steps. In this remarkable book, John SanGiovanni helps us value our young learners&#x2019; misconceptions and incomplete understandings as much as their correct ones&#x2015;because it&#x2019;s the gap in their understanding today that holds the secrets to planning tomorrow&#x2019;s best teaching.<br> <br> SanGiovanni lays out 160 high-quality tasks aligned to the standards and big ideas of grades K-2 mathematics, including &nbsp;counting and representing numbers, number relationships and comparison, addition and subtraction within 100 and 1000, money and time, &nbsp;and multiplication and division. The tasks are all downloadable so you can use or modify them for instruction and assessment.&nbsp;Each big idea offers a starting task followed by:&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li>what makes it a high-quality taskwhat you might anticipate before students work with the task </li> <li>4 student examples of the completed task showcasing a distinct "gap" </li> <li>commentary on what precisely counts for mathematical understanding and the next instructional steps </li> <li>commentary on the misconception or incomplete understanding so you learn why the student veered off course&nbsp; </li> <li>three additional tasks aligned to the mathematics topic and ideas about what students might do with these additional tasks. </li> </ul> <p>It&#x2019;s time to break our habit of rushing into re-teaching for correctness and instead get curious about the space between right and wrong answers.&nbsp;<em>Mine the Gap for Mathematical Understanding</em>&nbsp;is a book you will return to again and again to get better at selecting tasks that will uncover students&#x2019; reasoning&#x2015;better at discerning the quality and clarity of students&#x2019; understanding&#x2015;and better at planning teaching based on the gaps you see.&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><b>John SanGiovanni</b> is a mathematics supervisor in Howard County, Maryland.

Mine the Gap for grades K&#x2013;2 teachers really unpacks! Not only does the book provide<br> dozens of great mathematical tasks, but&#x2015;perhaps more important&#x2015;it gives teachers the chance<br> to consider each task; anticipate student responses&#x2015;a critical first step in formative assessment;<br> analyze actual student responses; and then consider what they would do in the classroom.<br> Thoughts about modifying each task provide another option for each task. At a time when teachers<br> are encouraged to regularly provide students with tasks that promote reasoning and problem<br> solving, this book will help teachers dig deeper as they mine for understandings." Author: Francis (Skip) Fennell<br><br>"Too often students (and parents and teachers) have the notion that the goal in math should<br> be to get the right answer. Yet insight into misconceptions and students&#x2019; thinking can tell us<br> much more about what students know (and don&#x2019;t know) beyond simply a correct or incorrect<br> answer. SanGiovanni offers teachers a treasure trove of rich tasks and student work on those<br> tasks. Examples of how to analyze student thinking and next instructional steps make this a volume<br> that should be on every K&#x2013;2 math teacher&#x2019;s desk!" Author: Linda Gojak<br><br>"This work does what other books only attempt to do. It combines instruction, assessment, and<br> practice with open-ended and rich tasks that allow for teachers to not only immediately implement<br> the ideas but also understand the content and pedagogy behind them. The tasks, which are<br> immediately implementable and customizable, engage each and every learner.

Author Matthew Butterick, an attorney and Harvard-trained typographer, dispelled the myth that legal documents are incompatible with excellent typography. Butterick explained how to get professional results with the tools you already have quickly and easily. Revised and updated, Typography for Lawyers, 2nd builds on the topics and tutorials included in the first edition with 20 pages of new material, covering topics such as email, footnotes, alternate figures, and OpenType features, providing advice for presentations, contracts, grids of numbers, and court opinions, and including essays on the font copyrights, screen-reading considerations, and typographic disputes that have reached the courts.</p><p>Matthew Butterick got his degree in design and typography from Harvard. He began his career as a font designer in Boston. At the beginning of the Internet era, Butterick started Atomic Vision, a website-design company in San Francisco. Later, he attended UCLA law school and became a member of the California bar. In 2012, Butterick received the Legal Writing Institute s Golden Pen Award for Typography for Lawyers. Butterick's other projects include Practical Typography, an online book (<i>practicaltypography.com</i>), the fonts Equity, Concourse, Triplicate, and Advocate, and Pollen, software for publishing electronic books (<i>pollenpub.com</i>). Butterick lives in Los Angeles with his wife Jessica and Roxy the boxer.Butterick's book is for far more than litigators. A quick, thorough guide, this text offers much to typographic novices and experts alike. The book begins with a litany of sound arguments about why typography matters, and why it should be looked at as crucial to the law profession. But needless to say, nearly all the advice presented herein is equally applicable to writers or any professional services-based small business, not to mention graphic designers, students, and type mavens. --Nick Cox, <i>Book Review: Typography for Lawyers</i><br><br>Butterick's premise is that typography in legal documents should be held to the same standards as any professionally published material, because legal documents are professionally published material. There's a wealth of information that I wish I had had access to long before now. ... That's why Typography for Lawyers is such a godsend. --Ernie Svenson, <i>Typography matters, especially for lawyers</i><br><br>Typography for Lawyers is filled with nuggets, rationales and mechanics to make our papers look better. No, they won't make a loser appeal into a winner, but like wearing a decent suit to court, or polishing your shoes, it's one less detriment and one more benefit. Butterick's point, and mine, is that there's no good reason not to do it as well as it can be done. The book is a quick read, and one to keep on hand for reference, kinda like the Blue Book, the Essential Chester Barnard and Strunk &amp; White. --Scott Grennfield, <i>Book Review: Typography for Lawyers</i></p><h2>I&#39;m a Little Teapot (Iza Trapani&#39;s Extended Nursery Rhymes)</h2><p>Join our rambunctious teapot as he gets all steamed up just waiting to share his imaginative adventures with you.

Kate Fox, the social anthropologist who put the quirks and hidden conditions of the English under a microscope, is back with more biting insights about the nature of Englishness. This updated and revised edition of <i>Watching the English </i>- which over the last decade has become the unofficial guidebook to the English national character - features new and fresh insights on the unwritten rules and foibles of "squaddies," bikers, horse-riders, and more. <br>Fox revisits a strange and fascinating culture, governed by complex sets of unspoken rules and bizarre codes of behavior. She demystifies the peculiar cultural rules that baffle us: the rules of weather-speak. The ironic-gnome rule. The reflex apology rule. The paranoid pantomime rule. Class anxiety tests. The roots of English self-mockery and many more. An international bestseller, <i>Watching the English</i> is a biting, affectionate, insightful and often hilarious look at the English and their society.</p><p>Kate Fox, a social anthropologist, is Co-Director of the Social Issues Research Centre in Oxford and a Fellow of the Institute for Cultural Research.

Restorative justice argues that crime destroys people and relationships. Justice, then, must repair and rebuild people and relationships. This is true for men and women that are incarcerated as it is for victims.</b><br><br>The more than 2.3 million incarcerated individuals in the United States are often regarded as a throw-away population. While the criminal-justice system focuses on giving offenders "what they deserve," it does little to restore the needs created by crime or to explore the factors that lead to it. Restorative justice, with its emphasis on identifying the justice needs of everyone involved in a crime, is helping to restore prisoners' sense of humanity while holding them accountable for their actions.<br><br>In this book, Barb Toews, with years of experience in prison work, shows how people in prison can live restorative-justice principles. She shows how these practices can change prison culture and society.

The differences between the sexes are not matters of evolutionary accident, but are clear indications of God&#x2019;s sublime and perfect design for human happiness.

Nature has always been a strong source of inspiration for Anna. Her pictures are full of flowers and animals, of giraffes and elephants, of little biDon&#39;t use the &#34;e&#34; word (ecology) on this nighttime reverie. Into the gloaming go two children, intent on gathering an ensemble of fireflies. One, two, three, four . . . their quarry mounts to ten, flashing bright in their glass cage. When the children retire for the night, they find that the fireflies are &#34;Blinking so slowly in our jar.&#34; Off comes the lid and the fireflies escape into the night, dazzling again. Sturges&#39;s text counts up and back, a liturgical melodiousness in its pleasant, repetitive fashioning. The story is entirely at home in Vojtech&#39;s dreamy, nocturnal watercolors, the fireflies radiating just the right amount of magical incandescence. There is a summer&#39;s insouciance to the illustrations, which show warm, rich colors coaxed from the darkling landscape: The bright windows add a secure note, the shadowy silhouettes of the pine woods a touch of menace.

It is a tale of tragic love, set in turn-of-the-century Beirut. A young woman, Selma Karamy, is betrothed to a prominent religious man&#39;s nephew. The protagonist (a young man that Gibran perhaps modeled after himself) falls in love with this woman. They begin to meet in secret, however they are discovered, and Selma is forbidden to leave her house, breaking their hopes and hearts. The book highlights many of the social issues of the time in the Eastern Mediterranean, including religious corruption, the rights of women (and lack thereof), and the weighing up of wealth and happiness.</p><p>Kahlil Gibran deeply stirred readers the world over with "The Prophet", a modern classic of surpassing beauty and moral grandeur. In "The Broken Wings", the Lebanese poet-philosopher reveals the same artistry and wisdom that have enshrined his name in the hearts of millions as an "Immortal Prophet" and a "Dante of the Twentieth Century". <p>This is the exquisitely tender story of a love that beats desperately against the taboos of Oriental tradition. With great sensitivity and lyricism, Gibran describes his passion as a youth for Selma Karamy, the beautiful girl of Beirut who first unfolded to him the secrets of love. But it is a love that is doomed by a social convention which forces Selma into marriage with another man. </p><p>Portraying the exalted happiness and infinite sorrow of his relationship with Selma, Gibran at the same time probes the spiritual meaning of human existence with profound compassion. And he does so in a poetic prose that has magic and majesty.</p><b>Kahlil Gibran</b> (1883-1931) was a Lebanese poet, philosopher, artist, and writer. The millions of people familiar with his work consider him the genius of his age.</p><h2>NRSV Go-Anywhere Compact Thinline Bible with the Apocrypha (Bonded Leather, Navy</h2><p><p>Now available in the popular thinline size, perfect for personal use, for travel, or for gift giving, the New Revised Standard Version Bible is the most trusted, accurate, and readable translation of the Bible available, approved for use by all major Christian denominations.Due to the compact size of this item, the font size is small. </p></p><p><p>The NRSV Go-Anywhere Compact Thinline Bible is the most portable edition of the NRSV available today.

Then a letter from her Aunt Euterpe arrives, and everything changes. It&#39;s 1893, the year of the World&#39;s Columbian Exposition-the &#34;wonder of the age&#34;-a.k.a. the Chicago World&#39;s Fair. Aunt Euterpe is inviting the Becketts to come for a visit and go to the fair! Award-winning author Richard Peck&#39;s fresh, realistic, and fun-filled writing truly brings the World&#39;s Fair-and Rosie and her family-to life.</p><p>Granddad emits a strangled sound, 13-year-old Rosie pitches right off her chair, and young Buster just vibrates. What event catapults the Beckett family into such a state? The arrival of a letter from distant Chicago--and not just a letter, an invitation from Mama's elusive, wealthy sister Aunt Euterpe. She decides that it's high time for the children to see the world beyond "the four walls of a one-room country schoolhouse." And what better opportunity than the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, to honor the 400th anniversary of the discovery of America? Spanish nobility, President Cleveland, and Ferris wheels, oh my! Richard Peck, Newbery Medal-winning author of <i>A Year Down Yonder</i>, paints a charming portrait of a 19th-century farming family turned upside down by a visit to the big city. Narrator Rosie is friendly and funny as she describes the instant (if not entirely successful) citification of her family, encounters with Buffalo Bill himself, and her own delightfully eccentric Granddad who named his horse after Lillian Russell (which is just fine until they meet her at the fair). This wonderful, witty glimpse into 19th-century America--sprinkled with historical photographs--concludes with an insightful essay on the Exposition. Heartily recommended.

Here is a tour de force that combines the real people of the time with an enormously engaging new fictional family, spinning them all into a whirlwind of humor, misadventure, and charms beyond measure.<br><br>On the brink of adulthood (not to mention a whole new century), Rosie makes her first trip to the big city, along with her wide-eyed siblings and their rascally old granddad. There, amidst the wonders of the fair, Rosie discovers the world and herself, while also coming face-to-face with some of the era's most famous people--including showgirl Lillian Russell and Colonel William F.

This book provides grief counselors with creative interventions to engage, assess, and treat bereaved children and families.

But I wouldn&#x2019;t mind being a magician who slices people in half on America&#x2019;s Got Talent. I&#x2019;d like to set the Guinness World Record for burping the Chinese alphabet. I&#x2019;ve seen lots of YouTube videos. I know what it takes to become famous.<br> <br>I never, ever, imagined getting famous by playing the violin at the Brisk River Elementary School fall concert.<br> <br>The concert program booklet calls it a &#x201c;memorable night of musical escape.&#x201d; The sweaty audience slumped on rows of metal folding chairs looks ready to escape. It feels like three hundred degrees in the school cafeteria. But &#x201c;memorable&#x201d;? I&#x2019;m sure everyone will forget tonight as soon as they rush out the doors to the parking lot.<br> <br>Ms. Sterling is waving her baton like she&#x2019;s conducting the National Symphony Orchestra, not the fourth-grade orchestra. I&#x2019;m sitting on the second level of the stage, melting in a white shirt, black pants, and purple clip-on bow tie. It&#x2019;s extra hot because I&#x2019;m wearing my basketball training jersey and shorts underneath. I ran over from the gym right after practice. And I couldn&#x2019;t find my dress shoes this morning, so I&#x2019;m in my sneakers. My basketball and empty water bottle are tucked under my chair.<br> <br> <br> <br>Our third song goes perfectly. Ms. Sterling raises her hands, soaking in the applause. Next is our finale, &#x201c;Tribal Lament.&#x201d; It ends with a cool drum solo by Antonio. I raise my violin to my chin. Abigail, who&#x2019;s sitting next to me, starts to whisper.<br> <br>&#x201c;Zayd! I need more room.&#x201d; She sticks her bow out so far that it almost touches my face.<br> <br>&#x201c;See?&#x201d; she whines. &#x201c;Move over!&#x201d;<br> <br>I scoot my chair to the right a few inches and start playing.<br> <br>&#x201c;I need more room!&#x201d; Abigail hisses.<br> <br>It looks like Abigail has plenty of room, but she&#x2019;s glaring at me. So I scoot over again, way over to the edge of the riser. I shift in my seat, still playing, and then&#x2014;oh no! My chair tips over and I&#x2019;m falling. AHHHHH!<br> <br>I see my life flashing before my eyes. Wait, no. Phew. It&#x2019;s the flashes of everyone&#x2019;s cameras. And then, CRASH! I land smack in the middle of the drums, barely missing Antonio. My chair clangs to the floor somewhere behind me. WHACK! My basketball smacks me on the head before bouncing into the audience.<br> <br>All the music stops. I hear gasps from the crowd. Then there&#x2019;s nothing but silence. Ms. Sterling rushes over to me, her face pale.<br> <br>&#x201c;Zayd! Are you okay? Can you move?&#x201d; she shrieks.<br> <br>I nod, take her hand, and slowly stand up. My shirt is untucked and a little torn, and my bright red training jersey is peeking through. My bow tie is missing. But nothing seems broken, especially not my playing arms. For playing basketball, I mean. I can&#x2019;t afford to be injured. My league has tryouts coming up in just four weeks, and I have to make the gold team.<br> <br>Ms. Sterling looks like she&#x2019;s about to cry. I can feel everyone&#x2019;s eyes fixed on me. And then, suddenly, I understand what &#x201c;the show must go on&#x201d; means.<br> <br>I face the audience and take an extra-deep bow. Everyone cheers, whistles, and applauds. And then I actually get . . . a STANDING OVATION! I bow again and can&#x2019;t help but laugh with the crowd. I rub my head where the basketball hit me, and someone from the audience throws it back to me.<br> <br>As I climb back onto the risers, Abigail helps me set up my chair.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; she mumbles.<br> <br>If you had told me I was going to be famous today, I wouldn&#x2019;t have believed it. My older sister Zara posted a video of my fall on YouTube. It&#x2019;s already been viewed forty thousand times. In six hours! I can only imagine how famous I&#x2019;ll be by tomorrow. And in the end, this concert might actually be memorable after all.</p><h2>Real Change: Becoming More Like Jesus in Everyday Life</h2><p><p>Every honest Christian knows the need for change.

The canal was successful in sustaining desert farming communities and also created a scenic canyon with a stream--the only stream in Bryce Canyon National Park. <br><br>The cave, cooling stream, and waterfall make this a fun short hike, well-suited to hikers of all ages and abilities. The location on Highway 12 in the northern section of the park, just east of the park entrance, makes Water Canyon a convenient place to stop and stretch your legs after several hours in the car and before entering the heart of Bryce Canyon.<br><br><b>Route</b><br>From the roadside parking area the wide trail makes a gentle ascent into the canyon amidst hoodoos on the upper slopes casting a glow of orange and white. Although Water Canyon is not a large canyon, it has a sense of openness with a mix of bristlecone and limber pines on the surrounding slopes. <br>You'll appreciate the sturdy bridge with the metal railing. The two bridges are fairly recent additions and replace numerous previous bridges which had been washed away during flash floods. It's hard to imagine that the small stream you're crossing could swell to a torrent capable of washing out a bridge but it gives you a sense of the potential for flash flooding in a desert canyon.<br><br>The stream has a rather inglorious name--Tropic Ditch--but a proud history. It's just over a hundred years since the stream has been in existence, but the stream has already had a profound effect on the canyon ecosystem. It has attracted wildlife not previously seen in the area. Flora such as the Watson Bog Orchid and the Mountain Death Camas appear in the now-watered canyon, and over time the geology of the canyon will continue to become more like other V-shaped stream-cut canyons.<br><br>After crossing the bridge, the trail ascends more steeply and soon arrives at a fork. Take the route to the left leading on to Mossy Cave. Technically more a grotto or alcove than a cave, Mossy Cave invites inspection nonetheless. This shallow, moss-filled alcove fed by an underground spring, so it is adorned with ferns and in winter with icicles.<br><br>Now returning down the trail to the fork, take the branch to the right (north) this time and head in the direction of the waterfall. This 15-foot plunge drops into a circular pool exposing dolomite limestone bedrock. The pools are perfect for a refreshing break on a hot summer day.<br><br>Along with the hoodoos you can also spot several windows sculpted into the rock above the falls to your right. It's a short trail leading to the window and makes for a fun add-on with some great views down to the waterfall. Retrace your route down the canyon to return to the trailhead.<br><br><b>Trailhead GPS Coordinates:</b> N37" 39.946' W112" 6.619<br>From the junction of Utah Highway 63 and Utah Highway 12 continue east on Highway 12 for 3.7 miles to a small parking area located on the south side of the highway.<br><br><b>SIDEBAR: The Tropic Ditch</b><br>In 1874, a few pioneers heard about the Paria Valley from the Native Americans. It sounded appealing, with a favorable climate, abundant grazing, arable land, timber, coal, and water. The pioneers soon settled the communities of Cannonville and Henrieville which lie to the east of Bryce Canyon on the Paria River.<br><br>But the growth of these communities forced farmers to look for more reliable water sources than the seasonal flow of the Paria River. They conceived a plan to bring water from the East Fork Sevier River on the Paunsaugunt Plateau to the west of Bryce Canyon to augment the flow of the Paria River.<br>From 1890 to 1892 Mormon pioneers labored with picks and shovels to carve a 10-mile canal across the Paunsaugunt Plateau. Since that time, except during the drought of 2002, the Tropic Ditch as supplied irrigation water to the Paria Valley. The water rights extend from mid-April to mid-October when you'll see water pouring over the falls and down the canyon.<br></p><h2>The Art of Comic Book Writing: The Definitive Guide to Outlining, Scripting, and Pitching Your Sequential Art Stories</h2><p><b>A practical guide for beginner and advanced comic book writers that outlines the steps needed to successfully craft a story for sequential art. </b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this latest book in the SCAD Creative Essentials series from the esteemed Savannah College of Art and Design, comics writer and instructor Mark Kneece gives aspiring comic book writers the essential tools they need to write scripts for sequential art with confidence and success.

The insidious whispers grow ever stronger in his head, threatening to take over his very identity and unleash the Reapers on an unsuspecting galaxy.<br>&nbsp;<br>This novel is based on a Mature-rated video game.</p><p>Drew Karpyshyn is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of<i> </i><b>Star Wars: Darth Bane: Path of Destruction, Star Wars: Darth Bane: Rule of Two, and Star Wars: Darth Bane: Dynasty of Evil,</b> as well as several other fantasy and science fiction novels, including <b>Mass Effect: Revelation</b> and <b>Mass Effect: Ascension</b>. He is also an award-winning writer/designer for the computer game company BioWare, where he was lead writer on Mass Effect and the popular Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic video games. After spending most of his life in Canada, he headed south in search of a climate more conducive to year-round golf. He now lives in Texas with his wife, Jennifer, and their cat.ONE<br><br> Paul Grayson knew the Illusive Man was still looking for him. It had been almost three years since he had betrayed Cerberus for the sake of his daughter, but even if thirty years had passed he knew they wouldn&#x2019;t give up the hunt.<br><br> He had changed his name, of course: Paul Grayson was gone; he went by Paul Johnson now. But creating a new identity for himself was only the first line of defense; it wouldn&#x2019;t hold up should any of the Illusive Man&#x2019;s agents come across his credentials. And his agents were everywhere.<br><br> Since its inception, Cerberus had seeded operatives throughout nearly every branch of the Alliance government. There was almost no place in Council space he could run where they wouldn&#x2019;t eventually track him down. So he had fled to Omega.<br><br> The Illusive Man had never managed to secure a foothold on the enormous space station that served as the de facto capital of the Terminus Systems. Cerberus was well known for its radical pro-human agenda, making its agents extremely unpopular among the various alien warlords, gang leaders, and despots who held sway on Omega. Even if they suspected that Grayson was hiding here, it wouldn&#x2019;t be easy for them to get to him.<br><br> It was something of an irony to Grayson that the skills he had learned while working for Cerberus&#x2014; espionage and assassination&#x2014;were proving so useful in carving out a new life for himself as a mercenary on Omega. He had been trained to kill aliens; now he was working for one.<br><br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;re wasting time,&#x201d; Sanak grumbled, setting his sniper rifle to the side. He tugged at his combat suit as he shifted to find a more comfortable position behind the stacked crates that were concealing Grayson and him from view.<br><br> Grayson kept his own weapon trained on the ship on the far side of the loading bay. He was acutely aware of how careful his batarian partner was to not make any physical contact with him as he rummaged around.<br><br> &#x201c;We wait for Liselle&#x2019;s report,&#x201d; he said flatly.<br><br> The batarian had turned his head to glare with all four eyes at the man crouched beside him. He blinked the uppermost pair, but the lower set remained still as stone.<br><br> &#x201c;You always want to wait, human,&#x201d; Sanak snarled. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a sign of weakness.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a sign of intelligence,&#x201d; Grayson snapped back. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m in charge.&#x201d;<br><br> Sanak knew only one way to deal with problems: charge into them headfirst. It made working with him difficult at times. His general dislike of humans&#x2014;and Grayson&#x2019;s deeply ingrained mistrust of batarians&#x2014;didn&#x2019;t help matters.<br><br> The two species had a checkered history. Humanity had expanded quickly after bursting onto the galactic scene, pushing the batarians out of the Skyllian Verge. The batarians had retaliated with violence, triggering a war between the two cultures&#x2014;a war the batarians had lost. Now they were outcasts and pariahs in the civilized worlds of Council space&#x2014;hardly ever seen, regarded with suspicion and mistrust.<br><br> On the streets of Omega, however, they seemed to be on every other corner. Since leaving Cerberus, Grayson had worked hard to overcome the xenophobia that had been drilled into him by the Illusive Man. But old habits died hard, and he was in no hurry to embrace the &#x201c;four-eyed menace.&#x201d;<br><br> Fortunately, he and Sanak didn&#x2019;t have to like each other to work together. Aria had made that clear to both of them on several occasions.<br><br> &#x201c;Seven targets in total,&#x201d; Liselle&#x2019;s soft voice chimed in his earpiece. &#x201c;All members in position and awaiting orders.&#x201d;<br><br> Grayson felt the familiar rush of adrenaline coursing through his body in anticipation of the kill. Beside him he sensed Sanak training his weapon onto the ship, mirroring Grayson&#x2019;s pose.<br><br> &#x201c;Go,&#x201d; Grayson whispered, the single word triggering a barrage of gunfire from the far side of the warehouse as Liselle and her team went into action.<br><br> A second later four turians stumbled into view from around the far side of the vessel. Their backs were to Grayson and Sanak, their attention and their weapons focused on Liselle&#x2019;s ambush.<br><br> Grayson released the air in his lungs in a long, slow breath as he squeezed the trigger. One of the turians dropped, the kinetic barriers of his combat suit too drained by Liselle&#x2019;s opening salvo to stop the sniper round that took him in the back of his bony skull.<br><br> An instant later two more went down, courtesy of a pair of perfectly placed shots from Sanak.<br><br> I may not like the bastard, Grayson thought as he took aim at the final adversary, but he gets the job done.<br><br> The last turian had just enough time to take two steps toward the cover of a nearby crate before Grayson took him between the shoulder blades.<br><br> There were several seconds of absolute silence before Grayson spoke into his mouthpiece. &#x201c;Four targets neutralized on our side.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Three more over here,&#x201d; Liselle responded. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s all of them.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s move,&#x201d; Grayson said to Sanak, leaping out from behind the cover of the crate and racing toward the fallen aliens.<br><br> The turians were members of the Talon gang, and the warehouse was a building deep inside Talon territory. Given the time of night and the remote location, it was unlikely anyone had heard the shots. But there was always a chance, and the longer they stayed the more likely they&#x2019;d have to deal with reinforcements.<br><br> By the time he and Sanak reached the bodies, Liselle and the two batarians that made up the rest of her team were already rifling through their victims&#x2019; clothes.<br><br> &#x201c;Five kilos so far,&#x201d; the blue-skinned asari informed Grayson, holding up several plastic bags tightly packed with a fine, rosy powder. &#x201c;Ninety, maybe ninety-five percent pure.&#x201d;<br><br> From personal experience, Grayson knew it took only a small pinch of refined red sand to get a human high. Five kilos was enough to keep an entire apartment complex floating for the better part of a year. A stash this size could easily fetch six figures back in Council space. Which was precisely why Aria had ordered this hit.<br><br> There were no actual laws on Omega, no police force. Order was maintained solely by the gangs that ran the space station. But though there were no laws, there were rules. Rule number one: don&#x2019;t cross Aria T&#x2019;Loak.<br><br> &#x201c;Two more kilos on this one,&#x201d; Sanak said, pulling another tightly wrapped brick from inside the vest of the corpse he was searching.<br><br> &#x201c;This one got caught in the cross fire,&#x201d; one of the other batarians said, holding up a bag so Grayson could see the grains of sand streaming out of the tiny hole in the side.<br><br> &#x201c;Patch it up!&#x201d; Grayson snapped angrily, taking a quick step back.<br><br> Red sand had no effect on batarians or asari, but one good whiff and he&#x2019;d be dusted for the rest of the night.<br><br> &#x201c;Aria wants it all,&#x201d; he reminded them. &#x201c;The whole shipment. She&#x2019;s sending a message.&#x201d;<br><br> Known as the Pirate Queen, Aria had been the de facto ruler of Omega for over two centuries. Every other gang paid tribute to her in some form or another for the privilege of doing business on the station. Those that tried to cut Aria out&#x2014;say by refusing to give her a piece of their red sand trafficking business&#x2014;suffered the consequences.<br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s it,&#x201d; Liselle declared, standing up as she finished her examination of the last body.<br><br> Even though his mind was focused on the mission, Grayson couldn&#x2019;t help but be struck once again by the ethereal beauty of the woman before him. The asari as a whole were gorgeous by human standards: the mono-gendered species closely resembled human females, though their pigmentation was typically blue. Instead of hair they had sculpted, flowing folds of skin covering their scalp, but that did little to take away from their sexual appeal.<br><br> Liselle was considered extremely attractive, even among her own kind, and her form-fitted combat suit accentuated every curve. The part of Grayson&#x2019;s mind that still harbored the Cerberus-bred mistrust of aliens couldn&#x2019;t help but wonder if it was merely her physical appearance that was so stunning, or if it was something more.<br><br> In addition to being a species of biotics, the asari were known to have subtle yet powerful empathic&#x2014;almost telepathic&#x2014;abilities. Some believed they used these talents to influence the perceptions of others, making themselves appear more attractive than they actually were. If that was in fact the case, then Liselle was exceptionally skilled at the art.<br><br> &#x201c;Secure the sand and move out,&#x201d; Grayson ordered, snapping his mind back to the task at hand. &#x201c;Stay tight, stay alert. Remember&#x2014;we&#x2019;re still in enemy territory.&#x201d;</p><h2>Heidi Heckelbeck Makes a Wish: Super Special!

Why is that? More often than we realize, it&#x2019;s because we&#x2019;ve absorbed messages that curve us in on ourselves. These messages have even crept into the church, disguised as truth. It&#x2019;s time we learn to discern teaching that&#x2019;s toxic from that which is true and pure.</p><p><em>Flourish</em> equips us with tools to identify the lies that come at us about where to find real life. As we dig deep into what God says in his Word, we will learn to discern the worldly influences that threaten to warp our understanding of what it really means to be a Christian, and emerge with a faith that flourishes&#x2015;full of the abundant life Jesus promises.</p></p><p><p><strong>Lydia Brownback</strong>&nbsp;(MAR, Westminster Theological Seminary) is the author of several books and a speaker at women&#x2019;s conferences around the world.

Recent years have brought us countless articles, books, podcasts, and conferences based on the word <i>flourish</i>. &#x2018;Follow this program,&#x2019; they say, or &#x2018;switch to this diet,&#x2019; or &#x2018;become more mindful,&#x2019; and &#x2018;you&#x2019;ll finally flourish in your life and in your relationships. Guaranteed!&#x2019; In this book, Lydia Brownback looks for and finds what I&#x2019;m convinced is the true key to human flourishing.

She takes on common destructive states of mind that often hinder Christians from walking in the freedom that is theirs by grace.

What if the siren calls of society and culture are misleading us? What if real flourishing makes foolish the wisdom of the world and turns today&#x2019;s prevailing solution on its head? What if self-focus leads to losing the life that really matters, and focusing outside ourselves leads to finding it? Lydia Brownback has a beat on the answer. There is a true flourishing, and it may not be what you think&#x2015;and it is better than what we dream. This is no shallow guide to &#x2018;flourishing&#x2019; when all in life is well.

Trouble was, she was out of practice. So she devised a series of 32, mostly half-hour exercises to get her writing muscle back in shape. Thus was born <i>A Writer's Workbook</i>. In it, Sharp embraces warming up with a journal. She is personable and humorous, often returning to the subject of her addiction to coffee. Although her book is recommended in Elizabeth Gilbert's (<i>Pilgrims</i>) introduction for any reluctant writer in need of a jump-start, it seems best suited to fictioneers. "Write a character description of yourself," an early exercise suggests. "Write down as many food memories as you can recall," urges another. "Take yourself through 24 hours in your character's day," and "See if you can come up with a true list of bad behavior." While the exercises cumulatively don't help you create a greater whole, if they get you writing, they've done their job. And as you write, keep in mind: "You've got to get in the habit of harvesting all the acreage," says Sharp. "The pretty flowers are great, but the bent and twisted and screwy ones are more interesting." <i>--Jane Steinberg</i><p><b>Caroline Sharp</b> has a degree in psychology from Princeton University, an MFA from Columbia University, and is a graduate of the Writer's Boot Camp.

In Stuart&#x2019;s wonderful book, These 6 Things, he draws extensively on his own classroom experience to show teachers how to help students use their everyday argument skills to energize the classroom, meet these standards, and achieve success.

When I read about the poster on his class wall that says "[In this class] we are all about becoming better thinkers, readers, writers, speakers, and people," I think of the years of hard work I have watched Dave Stuart put into his craft and this book, and how the same statement applies to Dave Stuart himself: He is all about becoming a better thinker, reader, writer, speaker, person&#x2015;and teacher, and showing us how we can do the same. -- Jim Burke<br><br>If you&#x2019;re searching for balance as a teacher of literacy, search no further.

A great tool for new teachers and seasoned teachers alike to find their "Everest" and pursue it. -- David T.

Quite a lot, actually, and some of it isn&#x2019;t good for our financial health. In <i>Your Money and Your Brain</i>, Jason Zweig explains why smart people make stupid financial decisions&#x2014;and what they can do to avoid these mistakes. Zweig, a veteran financial journalist, draws on the latest research in neuroeconomics, a fascinating new discipline that combines psychology, neuroscience, and economics to better understand financial decision making. He shows why we often misunderstand risk and why we tend to be overconfident about our investment decisions. <i>Your Money and Your Brain</i> offers some radical new insights into investing and shows investors how to take control of the battlefield between reason and emotion.<br> <br><i>Your Money and Your Brain</i> is as entertaining as it is enlightening. In the course of his research, Zweig visited leading neuroscience laboratories and subjected himself to numerous experiments. He blends anecdotes from these experiences with stories about investing mistakes, including confessions of stupidity from some highly successful people. Then he draws lessons and offers original practical steps that investors can take to make wiser decisions.<br> <br>Anyone who has ever looked back on a financial decision and said, &#x201c;How could I have been so stupid?&#x201d; will benefit from reading this book.</p><p><b>Jason Zweig</b> is a senior writer for <i>Money</i> magazine and has been a guest columnist for Time and cnn.com. He is also the editor of the revised edition of Benjamin Graham's <i>The Intelligent Investor,</i> the classic text that Warren Buffett has described as "by far the best book about investing ever written." Before joining <i>Money,</i> Zweig was the mutual funds editor at <i>Forbes.</i> <br><br>In 2001 Zweig was named "best financial columnist for a national publication" by Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism.

An apparatus with which we think that we think.</p><p> --<i> Ambrose Bierce</i></p><p>"How could I have been such an idiot?" If you've never yelled that sentence at yourself in a fury, you're not an investor. There may be nothing across the entire spectrum of human endeavor that makes so many smart people feel so stupid as investing does. That's why I've set out to explain, in terms any investor can understand, what goes on inside your brain when you make decisions about money. To get the best use out of any tool or machine, it helps to know at least a little about how it works; you will never maximize your wealth unless you can optimize your mind. Fortunately, over the past few years, scientists have made stunning discoveries about the ways the human brain evaluates rewards, sizes up risks, and calculates probabilities. With the wonders of imaging technology, we can now observe the precise neural circuitry that switches on and off in your brain when you invest.</p><p>I've been a financial journalist since 1987, and nothing I've ever learned about investing has excited me more than the spectacular findings emerging from the study of "neuroeconomics." Thanks to this newborn field -- a hybrid of neuroscience, economics, and psychology -- we can begin to understand what drives investing behavior not only on the theoretical or practical level, but as a basic biological function. These flashes of fundamental insight will enable you to see as never before what makes you tick as an investor.</p><p>On this ultimate quest for financial self-knowledge, I'll take you inside laboratories run by some of the world's leading neuroeconomists and describe their fascinating experiments firsthand, since I've had my own brain studied again and again by these researchers. (The scientific consensus on my cranium is simple: It's a mess in there.)</p><p>The newest findings in neuroeconomics suggest that much of what we've been told about investing is wrong. In theory, the more we learn about our investments, and the harder we work at understanding them, the more money we will make. Economists have long insisted that investors know what they want, understand the tradeoff between risk and reward, and use information logically to pursue their goals.</p><p>You're not alone. Like dieters lurching from Pritikin to Atkins to South Beach and ending up at least as heavy as they started, investors habitually are their own worst enemies, even when they know better.</p><p></p><p>� Everyone knows that you should buy low and sell high -- and yet, all too often, we buy high and sell low.</p><p>� Everyone knows that beating the market is nearly impossible -- but just about everyone thinks he can do it.</p><p>� Everyone knows that panic selling is a bad idea -- but a company that announces it earned 23 cents per share instead of 24 cents can lose $5 billion of market value in a minute-and-a-half.</p><p>� Everyone knows that Wall Street strategists can't predict what the market is about to do -- but investors still hang on every word from the financial pundits who prognosticate on TV.</p><p>� Everyone knows that chasing hot stocks or mutual funds is a sure way to get burned -- yet millions of investors flock back to the flame every year. Many do so even though they swore, just a year or two before, never to get burned again.</p><p></p><p>One of the themes of this book is that our investing brains often drive us to do things that make no logical sense -- but make perfect emotional sense. That does not make us irrational. It makes us human. Our brains were originally designed to get more of whatever would improve our odds of survival and to avoid whatever would worsen the odds. Emotional circuits deep in our brains make us instinctively crave whatever feels likely to be rewarding -- and shun whatever seems liable to be risky.</p><p>To counteract these impulses from cells that originally developed tens of millions of years ago, your brain has only a thin veneer of relatively modern, analytical circuits that are often no match for the blunt emotional power of the most ancient parts of your mind. That's why knowing the right answer, and doing the right thing, are very different.</p><p></p><p>� An investor I'll call "Ed," a real estate executive in Greensboro, North Carolina, has rolled the dice on one high-tech and biotech company after another. At last count, Ed had lost more than 90% of his investment on at least four of these stocks. After Ed had lost 50% of his money, "I swore I'd sell if they fell another 10%," he recalls. "When they still kept dropping, I kept dropping my selling point instead of getting out. It felt like the only thing worse than losing all that money on paper would be selling and losing it for real." His accountant has reminded him that if he sells, he can write off the losses and cut his income tax bill -- but Ed still can't bear to do it. "What if they go up from here?" he asks plaintively. "Then I'd feel stupid <i>twice</i> -- once for buying them and once for selling them."</p><p>� In the 1950s, a young researcher at the RAND Corporation was pondering how much of his retirement fund to allocate to stocks and how much to bonds. An expert in linear programming, he knew that "I should have computed the historical co-variances of the asset classes and drawn an efficient frontier. Instead, I visualized my grief if the stock market went way up and I wasn't in it -- or if it went way down and I was completely in it. My intention was to minimize my future regret. So I split my contributions 50/50 between bonds and equities." The researcher's name was Harry M. Markowitz. Several years earlier, he had written an article called "Portfolio Selection" for the <i>Journal of Finance</i> showing exactly how to calculate the tradeoff between risk and return. In 1990, Markowitz shared the Nobel Prize in economics, largely for the mathematical breakthrough thathe had been incapable of applying to his own portfolio.</p><p>� Jack and Anna Hurst, a retired military officer and his wife who livenear Atlanta, seem like very conservative investors. They have no credit card debt and keep almost all of their money in dividend-paying, blue-chip stocks. But Hurst also has what he calls a "play" account, in which he takes big gambles with small amounts of money. Betting on a few long shots in the stock market is Hurst's way of trying to fund what he calls his "lottery dreams." Those dreams are important to Hurst, because he has amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease); he's been completely paralyzed since 1989. Hurst can invest only by operating a laptop computer with a special switch that reads the electrical signals in his facial muscles. In 2004, one of his "lottery" picks was Sirius Satellite Radio, one of the most volatile stocks in America. Hurst's dreams are to buy a Winnebago customized for quadriplegics and to finance an "ALS house" where patients and their families can get special care. He is both a conservative <i>and</i> aggressive investor.</p><p></p><p>In short, the investing brain is far from the consistent, efficient, logical device that we like to pretend it is. Even Nobel Prize winners fail to behave as their own economic theories say they should. When you invest -- whether you are a professional portfolio manager overseeing billions of dollars or a regular Joe with $60,000 in a retirement account -- you combinecold calculations about probabilities with instinctive reactions to the thrill of gain and the anguish of loss.</p><p>The 100 billion neurons that are packed into that three-pound clump of tissue between your ears can generate an emotional tornado when you think about money. Your investing brain does not just add and multiply and estimate and evaluate. When you win, lose, or risk money, you stir up some of the most profound emotions a human being can ever feel. "Financial decision-making is not necessarily about money," says psychologist Daniel Kahneman of Princeton University. "It's also about intangible motives like avoiding regret or achieving pride." Investing requires you to make decisions using data from the past and hunches in the present about risks and rewards you will harvest in the future -- filling you with feelings like hope, greed, cockiness, surprise, fear, panic, regret, and happiness. That's why I've organized this book around the succession of emotions that most people pass through on the psychological roller coaster of investing.</p><p>For most purposes in daily life, your brain is a superbly functioning machine,instantly steering you away from danger while reliably guiding you toward basic rewards like food, shelter, and love. But that same intuitively brilliant machine can lead you astray when you face the far more challenging choices that the financial markets throw at you every day. In all its messy, miraculous complexity, your brain is at its best and worst -- its most profoundly human -- when you make decisions about money.</p><p>And it's not as if emotion is the enemy and reason is the ally of good financial decisions. People who have suffered head injuries that prevent them from engaging the emotional circuitry in their brains can be terrible investors. Pure rationality with no feelings can be as bad for your portfolio as sheer emotion unchecked by reason. Neuroeconomics shows that you will get the best results when you harness your emotions, not when you strangle them. This book will help you strike the right balance between emotion and reason.</p><p>Most of all, this book should help you understand your investing self better than you ever have before. You may think you already know what kind of investor you are, but you are probably wrong. "If you don't know who you are," quipped the investment writer "Adam Smith" in his classic book <i>The Money Game</i>, then Wall Street "is an expensive place to find out." (The people who bought Internet stocks in 1999 because they thought they had a high tolerance for risk -- and then lost 95% over the next three years -- know just how expensive it can be.) Over the years, I've grown convinced that there are only three kinds of investors: those who think they are ge...</p></p><h2>Spent: Break the Buying Obsession and Discover Your True Worth</h2><p>Leading psychologist and financial commentator Palaian offers a tested, step-by-step guide to help people break the spending obsession by looking within.<br><br>Today, Americans are saving less, carrying larger debt loads, losing their homes to foreclosure, and filing bankruptcy in record numbers.

I know some will say, "I don't care what the sign is -- there are jerks in all twelve signs." So true. But before you write off this whole concept, read further. I too was the skeptic. However, once I started to pay attention to the various signs, talk to people directly, and discover personality traits all on my own, I began to think, hey, there may be something to this. And there was -- for me, anyway.<br>The point of this section is to let you, the reader, know what's up with <i>Black Love Signs:</i> how you can use this book as a reference, an owner's manual, or simply for information about twelve signs of the zodiac in general and the gory details of sex, love, and romance.<br>Writing this book was interesting to say the least. The response was overwhelming from both the men and women. But what was most interesting to me was the differences in perception between men and women about what makes for good romance, sex, and love. Take one couple that I interviewed, first separately and then together. Initially, the man told me he liked to make love for at least two hours. I mentioned his comments casually to his companion, not for verification, but in conjunction with another question. The female promptly corrected me by saying that the two hours included dinner, listening to music, and bathing. Thank you very much!<br>Some of the interviews were, of course, over the top, but I believe that many of the responses were strictly for shock value. Of course, my goal was to keep my poker face on because, after all, I thought I should be in control of the situation. But many times I wasn't at all, so I would simply leave the room for a minute, holler out aloud, compose myself, re-enter the room, and resume the interview.<br>For the purposes of this book, the Sun sign aspect of astrology, the most noted and popular portion of the zodiac, will be examined. The sun is the central most important celestial body; therefore, your Sun sign is the most important aspect of your birth chart. (Your birth chart is determined by the position of all the planets at the time of your birth.)<br>The sun moves around the earth each year and travels through all twelve signs of the zodiac. The Sun sign is the astrological sign that the sun is moving through at the time of your birth. For instance, the sun will move into the sign of Aquarius on January 20 and exit on February 18, so anyone born between January 23 and February 18 is known as an Aquarian, the sign of the water bearer.<br>From an astrological standpoint, the Sun sign controls your personality, style, general demeanor, and outward appearance. For example, if you're a Sagittarian, you are usually prone to casual dress and an over-the-top sense of humor. Therefore, you may be attracted to members of the opposite sex, or in the case of gays or lesbians, who have a great sense of humor, for instance, Cancers -- and they to you. But generally, Sagittarians and Cancers are not compatible. The initial appreciation making everyone laugh may be what draws these two together, but little else will hold their attention. Cancer is a water sign and Sag is a fire sign. And the water sign will be quick to put out the flame of the fire sign. In other words, water and fire don't mix.<br>Here's how the mix works. There are twelve signs of the zodiac, and those signs are divided into the four elements of the universe: earth, water, fire, and air. The earth signs are Capricorn, Virgo, and Taurus. The water signs are Cancer, Pisces, and Scorpio. The fire signs are Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius. And the air signs are Aquarius, Gemini, and Libra. Each element -- earth, fire, water, and air -- also reveals tidbits about the twelve Sun signs. Now consider these elements for a moment. We don't need a Ph.D. from the School of Astrology before we can pick up juicy and illuminating clues about a person's behavior.<br><b>Earth signs: Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn.</b> You're down to earth, practical, and cautious. Basically, you're always the same -- predictable, reliable, grounded, (Ground-ed, ground, earth -- get it?)<br><b>Fire signs: Leo, Sagittarius, Aries.</b> Like the element of fire, you're unpredictable, feisty, aggressive, impulsive, and hard to control. (To put it more bluntly, it's going to be your way or no way at all!)<br><b>Water signs: Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces.</b> In reality, people generally love to be close to lakes, river, oceans, and ponds. If you're a water sign, people love to be close to you because you're reassuring, emotional, intuitive, soothing, and nonthreatening.<br><b>Air Signs: Gemini, Libra, Aquarius.</b> If you're an air sign, you're independent, aloof, analytical, intriguing and very hard to keep up with. You must have freedom. Like air itself, you cannot be contained, harnessed, or backed into a corner. If this happens, you'll simply disappear.<br>From a practical standpoint, earth and water signs make beautiful mud together. And fire and air make a bonfire that's hard to put out.<br>Here's the breakdown of the Sun Signs:<br>Aries (March 21-April 19)<br>Taurus (April 20-May 20)<br>Gemini (May 21-June 20)<br>Cancer (June 21-July 22)<br>Leo (July 23-August 22)<br>Virgo (August 23-September 22)<br>Libra (September 23-October 22)<br>Scorpio (October 23-November 21)<br>Sagittarius (November 22-December 21)<br>Capricorn (December 22-January 19)<br>Aquarius (January 20-February 18)<br>Pisces (February 19-March 20)<br>Compatible mates:<br>Aries works best with Sagittarius, Leo, Gemini, and Aquarius.<br>Taurus is compatible with Virgo, Capricorn, Cancer, and Pisces.<br>Gemini is more suited to Leo, Aries, Aquarius, and Libra.<br>Cancer is better with Pisces, Scorpio, Virgo, and Taurus.<br>The four signs listed within each group are also compatible and interchangeable. In addition to Cancer, for example, Scorpios are compatible with Virgo, Taurus, and Pisces.<br>And please, please, please don't send those cards and letters declaring that you and your husband, boyfriend, girlfriend, or partner of twenty years are not listed here as being compatible. I didn't say all of this astrology business is foolproof. I'm simply saying that this method will enable you to leap over some of the many frogs before you meet the prince or princess of your dreams.<br>Your opposite sign is generally about six months from your birth date, or directly across from your sign on the circular horoscope. The following signs are opposites:<br>Aries-Libra<br>Taurus-Scorpio<br>Gemini-Sagittarius<br>Cancer-Capricorn<br>Leo-Aquarius<br>Virgo-Pisces<br>If you pay attention to astrology or know the birth date of your companion, you will probably realize that you're constantly meeting your opposite and the encounters are usually quite interesting. The conversations are stimulating; there's definitely chemistry. As you're trying to emphatically leave this courtship, exchange, date, or whatever, you'll constantly get this "Wait a minute, baby" plea. The magnetic attraction is so deep that to accept that the relationship ain't working! And you'll spend most of your time making up. But on the real tip, you know that after the morning after, reality sets in. You need to give it up and you know it!!!<br>Understanding astrology may clarify a few issues and help you bring closure to a relationship or make it blossom. But if homeboy or homegirl is certifiable, then astrology or numerology or the psychic hotline won't help. Use common sense, and get the hell out of Dodge City while there's still time!<br>Here's how to use <i>Black Love Signs.</i> At the beginning of each chapter the positive and negative love traits for that sign are listed. But bear in mind that when I list "kinky" or "S &amp; M" as a negative trait, this is open to interpretation. By and large the concept of what is negative or positive is all relative. It's really up to the reader to decide what's negative or positive.<br>Each chapter includes an overview of the sign and then some general information about both the man and woman and how to attract these creatures that we assume you can't live without!<br>Next is the Guide to a Love Connection, which includes a breakdown of the sign with the eleven other signs.

This section is a quick study in how to be romantic. You may already be romantic, but just in case you need some help, and need it quick, fast, and in a hurry, you can turn to this section.<br>Then comes the Sex section -- presumably the most popular section. Here's where to find out what your companion will and will not do.<br>After you've recovered from your long, sweaty hours in the sack, you can check out Money Matters, Pampering Tips, and Gift Ideas for your companion. You've definitely got to keep the groove going, so pay attention to these sections!<br>Once you've determined what all of the commotion is about with your companion, then you'll see tangible results. And I do mean <i>tangible:</i> She or he won't want to leave your side.<br><i>Black Love Signs</i> will also save you and your partner some embarrassing moments. For example, if you like swinging from the chandelier and she doesn't, some foreknowledge about her sexual leanings may help you keep the egg off your face. So chill out, and enjoy the book for what it is -- an exercise in fun!<br>P.S. One area I overlooked was that fine Lord-have-mercy-motor-scooter mate, where there is no rhyme or reason why you are in the relationship. Don't ask me for an explanation -- that's a whole other talk show!<br><br>We talked so much about sex, romance, and love that I forgot to mention one other important issue -- safe sex. Hopefully, being adults, we all know what safe sex is all about. It's called using a condom (the male or female variety). No matter what the astrological sign is, sexually transmitted diseases are an ever-present danger. So listen up! Protect yourself. I wanted to include a condom in every book to bring home my point. However, I didn't want the <i>context</i> of the book to be overshadowed by the <i>content.</i> So in two words -- Be safe!<br><br>Copyright � 1999 by Thelma Balfour</p><h2>Desmond and the Very Mean Word</h2><p><b>Based on a true story from Archbishop Desmond Tutu&#x2019;s childhood in South Africa, <i>Desmond and the Very Mean Word</i> reveals the power of words and the secret of forgiveness.</b><br><br>When Desmond takes his new bicycle out for a ride through his neighborhood, his pride and joy turn to hurt and anger when a group of boys shout a very mean word at him.

Eric also recorded and edited the sound on the audio CD as the illustrations were coming to life, using James&#39; characterizations in choosing takes and making editing choices.I was inspired to write &#34;Leo the Lightning Bug&#34; one summer while watching a tremendous thunder storm from a screened in porch in the woods. The lightning was striking all around the cottage when I saw a little lightning bug fly by the screen lighting up his own light! I thought to myself, &#34;I wonder if he thinks he&#39;s doing all of this?!?&#34; ...and Leo was born.

Physics charts its unseen workings. The two realms seem completely opposed. But consider that both strive to reveal truths for which there are no words&#x2013;&#x2013;with physicists using the language of mathematics and artists using visual images. In Art &amp; Physics, Leonard Shlain tracks their breakthroughs side by side throughout history to reveal an astonishing correlation of visions. From the classical Greek sculptors to Andy Warhol and Jasper Johns, and from Aristotle to Einstein, artists have foreshadowed the discoveries of scientists, such as when Monet and Cezanne intuited the coming upheaval in physics that Einstein would initiate.

Students Eni and Hopper and the tag-along comic relief Josh expand their skills as they are tutored by Mr. Bee in his coding classroom and laboratory deep under the school. Mr. Bee reveals to them the history of his fall from grace and his former coding school and drops hints that he knew Hopper's father. The characters are diverse, and this volume begins to touch more on their family lives. The rugby team, hired by the evil principal to find Mr. Bee's most powerful robot turtle, provides most of the villainous action. The narrative is spread a little thin, but the clearly articulated coding lessons are integrated into the plot through the emotional connections among the characters. The children are learning to code with the language Logo, with clever allusions to Logo's history. The black, white, and green drawings are simple and dynamic, with slapstick humor and cleverly depicted coding problems.

Author Mike Leinbach, Launch Director of the space shuttle program at NASA&#x2019;s John F. Kennedy Space Center was a key leader in the search and recovery effort as NASA, FEMA, the FBI, the US Forest Service, and dozens more federal, state, and local agencies combed an area of rural east Texas the size of Rhode Island for every piece of the shuttle and her crew they could find. Assisted by hundreds of volunteers, it would become the largest ground search operation in US history.

In the aftermath of tragedy, people and communities came together to help bring home the remains of the crew and nearly 40 percent of shuttle, an effort that was instrumental in piecing together what happened so the shuttle program could return to flight and complete the International Space Station. <b><i>Bringing</i> Columbia <i>Home</i></b> shares the deeply personal stories that emerged as NASA employees looked for lost colleagues and searchers overcame immense physical, logistical, and emotional challenges and worked together to accomplish the impossible.<br><br> Featuring a foreword and epilogue by astronauts Robert Crippen and Eileen Collins, and dedicated to the astronauts and recovery search persons who lost their lives, this is an incredible, compelling narrative about the best of humanity in the darkest of times and about how a failure at the pinnacle of human achievement became a story of cooperation and hope.</p><p><b>Michael D.

It&#x2019;s the ubiquitous style of dress comprising hoodies, sneakers, and T-shirts. In the beginning, a few brands defined this style; fewer still survived as streetwear went mainstream. They are the OGs, the &#x201c;heritage brands.&#x201d; The Hundreds is one of those persevering companies, and Bobby Hundreds is at the center of it all.</p><p>The creative force behind the brand, Bobby Kim, a.k.a. Bobby Hundreds, has emerged as a prominent face and voice in streetwear. In telling the story of his formative years, he reminds us that The Hundreds was started by outsiders; and this is truly the story of streetwear culture.</p><p>In <i>This Is Not a T-Shirt</i>, Bobby Hundreds cements his spot as a champion of an industry he helped create and tells the story of The Hundreds&#x2015;with anecdotes ranging from his Southern California, punk-DIY-tinged youth to the brand&#x2019;s explosive success. Both an inspiring memoir and an expert assessment of the history and future of streetwear, this is the tale of Bobby&#x2019;s commitment to his creative vision and to building a real community.</p></p><p><b>Bobby Kim</b>, also known as Bobby Hundreds, is an illustrator, documentarian, designer, and writer.

Bobby lives in Los Angeles with his wife and two sons. He also feels like notes about the author are redundant for memoirs.<p>&#x201c;Bobby is the embodiment of the type of hustle that streetwear was built on. In <i>This is Not a T-Shirt</i>, he maps out how to start a brand and blow it up while maintaining a core community&#x2015;it's like a streetwear bible slash history book.&#x201d; &#x2015;<b>Ronnie Fieg, founder of KITH</b></p><p>&#x201c;<i>This is Not a T-Shirt </i>tracks the history of surf and skate culture and their relationship to streetwear&#x2015;from the Zephyr skate team of the 1970s to brands like St�ssy, Supreme, BAPE, and, of course, The Hundreds, which has managed to stay relevant for more than fifteen years in a fickle market. This book is an insider's guide to the prevailing trends in youth culture of the last few decades that highlights the importance of self-discipline and self-confidence; the same traits that made me fall in love with skateboarding at a young age.&#x201d; <b>&#x2015;Tony Hawk</b></p><p>&#x201c;<i>This Is Not a T-Shirt </i>is a story about the power of culture, the power of community, and the power of values and beliefs to shape and influence identity in ways that we sometimes overlook.

But what she finds is an evil-tempered aunt and uncle and their spoiled daughters. It is only when she is swept up in a mystery involving a young Indian boy, a homesick child actor, and a missing inheritance that Maia lands in the middle of the Amazon adventure she's dreamed of. Readers of every generation will treasure Ibbotson's lush historical adventure that harkens back to the beloved classics of Frances Hodgson Burnett and Louisa May Alcott.</p><br><b><br></b> <br><b><br></b></p><p>Sent in 1910 to live with distant relatives who own a rubber plantation along the Amazon River, English orphan Maia is excited. She believes she is in for brightly colored macaws, enormous butterflies, and "curtains of sweetly scented orchids trailing from the trees." Her British classmates warn her of man-eating alligators and wild, murderous Indians. Unfortunately, no one cautions Maia about her nasty, xenophobic cousins, who douse the house in bug spray and forbid her from venturing beyond their coiffed compound. Maia, however, is resourceful enough to find herself smack in the middle of more excitement than she ever imagined, from a mysterious "Indian" with an inheritance, to an itinerant actor dreading his impending adolescence, to a remarkable journey down the Amazon in search of the legendary giant sloth.<p> Eva Ibbotson, author of <i>Dial-A- Ghost</i>, <i>Island of the Aunts</i>, and other positively delightful and droll fantasies, won a Gold Award for this book in the 2001 Nestl� Smarties Book Prizes.

The creators of <i>Mooncake: A Book of Shapes</i> (2000) offer a companion devoted to colors. Using rhymed verse, a young Chinese American girl introduces onlookers to some of the elements of her world. Many of the items mentioned are of Asian origin (for example, red dragons and firecrackers seen in Chinese New Year parades), but almost all the objects have a universal child appeal. Less familiar items, such as bottle gourds, chopsticks, and lychee fruits, are explained at the end of the book. Lin's simply drawn gouache illustrations, outlined in black, fairly explode with color, and Lin never lets a solid color serve where a pattern (many depicting Asian motifs) can be used. Although some spreads feature as many as 10 different patterns, they never appear cluttered, and the dominant hue is always clear. The endpapers, stripes of multihued dragon scales, are an attractive bonus. This is a must-have for libraries serving Chinese American populations, and it will be a welcome addition to preschool story hours for children of all backgrounds. <i>Kay Weisman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Visit her at www.kimberlysnyder.net.<br><br>Dearest Friend and Reader,<br><br>Welcome! I am just <em>thrilled </em>and honored that I get to share this journey with you as you discover your highest level of beauty and health.<br><br>I know how confusing it can be to navigate the numerous conflicting and ever-changing health philosophies that are out there. <em>Fruit is healthy. No, fruit has too much sugar! Be sure to count fat grams. No, wait. Make that to count carbs! </em>The conflicting advice used to always make me wonder if I was doing something wrong. What are we supposed to believe, and where do we turn for the answers?<br><br>Well, it <em>really </em>doesn't have to be that complicated. The goal of my book is to show you fundamental principles that will teach you how to unlock your highest potential beauty and achieve optimal health. As you'll find, it is actually very simple. And in our ever-progressing, complicated world, simplicity is a beautiful thing. We need not get swept up in the chaos of gimmicky new diets and worry if we are missing out on the Holy Grail of instant weight loss and wrinkle freedom. The truth is, it doesn't exist in the hot new diet. But there is an answer, and the exciting news is that it is right in front of you.<br><br>I want you to know right off the bat that this book is <em>not </em>about restriction in any sense. We will not be counting calories or grams of carbs, and we will not be restricted to eating in one particular way to fit into one dietary category. You can discover your ultimate health and beauty whether you are a vegan, vegetarian, raw foodist, pescatarian or omnivore. The broad concepts I outline in this book will work for everyone, and you will see and feel results, whatever your current diet. There is a phase, or eating plan, that works for everyone&#x2014;regardless of lifestyle, budget or personal tastes.<br><br>Once we get rid of restriction and embrace the idea of consuming an <em>abundance </em>of the right foods, we free ourselves up to understand, internalize and apply the true tenets of health and beauty. With just a few simple changes, you will look and feel better than you ever have before. That is my promise to you!<br><br>And the best part? You'll have all these benefits without counting calories or obsessing over tiny portion sizes or eating bland microwaved foods! You will be feasting on fresh, delicious and filling foods that will nourish every cell in your body so that a deeply healthful, radiant glow permeates from within. Your skin will become brighter, your hair shinier and your body more toned. Belly fat will drop off, and your eyes will sparkle with newfound energy. You can achieve true health and beauty naturally with <em>food. </em>This diet is that powerful.<br><br>I believe the word "health" is synonymous with the word "beauty." A healthy body is a beautiful body. Healthy skin, which is a reflection of our internal health, is beautiful skin. My definition of beauty is that it should be deep, lasting and magnetic, and grow from the inside out. The key to this kind of vibrant beauty is ongoing cleansing. When your cells and blood are clean and detoxified, your body is able to function optimally and you are able to maximize the use of plentiful minerals in your food. Your skin will radiate from the inside out, excess pounds will melt away and your body will achieve its perfect weight. We've all seen the kind of beauty I'm talking about. A woman who just <em>glows. </em>Now you, too, can sparkle with true beauty.<br><br>I wrote this book to help free you from wasting time and energy struggling with debilitating new diets and cleanses, wearing layers and layers of concealer and foundation to hide dulled, flawed skin and, yes, squeezing into your "fat" jeans. I promise you that it <em>is </em>possible to achieve your most beautiful self and your perfect weight&#x2014;while eating abundantly! And once you stop wasting time and energy worrying about your skin and weight, you can focus on your real goals and dreams.<br><br>Believe me, I have had my own share of weight and beauty battles. I struggled for years to control my weight as a superthin, calorie- and fat-gram-counting marathon runner. I was always swallowing a gnawing hunger, and at five foot five I was barely one hundred pounds, with hair as coarse as steel wool. Then I went in the totally opposite direction (yes, I admit it!). After graduating from college, I moved to Sydney, Australia, where I landed my first job. For my job, I was mingling with the A-list celebrity crowd, riding yachts and constantly eating out at fancy dinners and, yes, drinking expensive wine and partying.<br><br>I was spending all my time involved in activities I thought were so glamorous. <em>Hey, you're relaxing, </em>I told myself. <em>Have another glass. </em>Well, what I thought was healthy food&#x2014;soy burgers, fat-free milk, pretzels, yogurt, sushi and grilled veggie and mozzarella sandwiches&#x2014;added over thirty pounds to my small frame! My skin was a dull, zit-covered mess, and I believe that I looked older than I do now. I stopped working out regularly because I just didn't have the energy. Instead I turned to soy milk cappuccinos and Diet Coke to give me periodic "boosts" throughout the day.<br><br>When I developed a roll of fat on my once flat-as-a-board belly, I looked in the mirror and decided that I couldn't take it anymore. It was at that point that a new and highly influential person came into my life: an Australian holistic nutritionist who ran a nutritional detox center in Sydney. By chance (since I went so infrequently) I saw a small flyer of hers at the gym.<br><br>I had never before tried to do anything remotely detox related, but I was desperate for something to help and decided to give it a shot. This gorgeous, blond forty-something-year-old with sharp green eyes assessed my bumpy skin, my dull hair and the ridges in my nails and gave me a knowing look. She shook her head when she saw the thick coating of mucus on my tongue. The first questions she asked me were, "How often do you go to the bathroom?" and "Do you get bloated and gassy often?"<br><br>To which I replied, "What? Who cares about <em>that </em>stuff? I want to lose weight and make my skin look better!"<br><br>She smiled. <em>"That </em>stuff is what it is all about, my dear."<br><br>I was put on a stern detox program, cutting out dairy and refined carbs, like pretzels and white rice, from my diet immediately. This Aussie guru also made me concoctions for my liver with nineteen medicinal plants, my first introduction to the bounty of herbs in Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine. She also made her own face and body creams, and she forever changed the way I thought about my skin. She helped me see that the skin is our largest organ and functions like a mirror of what's going on inside the body: it offers us a direct reflection of the health achievements we make and the obstacles with which we struggle. My skin held all the answers, and all I had to do was pay attention to what it was telling me. Likewise, I learned that from 60 to 70 percent of what we put on our skin is absorbed through the skin into our bloodstream and liver. That certainly changed the way I thought of beauty products for good!<br><br>She jolted something awake in me and inspired my voracious passion for both natural health and skin care. I stopped partying and going out to dinner parties every night and read all the information and books the nutritionist gave me. I spent a lot of time with her, shopping at health stores, sipping herbal tea, and walking along Bondi Beach, where we both lived, having health discussions for hours. We became very close friends! The more I followed her advice, the better I looked and felt. The weight I'd gained melted off, and my skin started to clear up. I had so much energy that any thought of "needing" a coffee got banished from my mind! The results were incredible.<br><br>I knew I had to make a complete break from my current path in life. I didn't want to simply change the way I ate; I wanted to profoundly change the way I lived. Learning about natural health and skin care and the natural healing properties of plants made me jittery inside. I was so excited! Even though I still had no idea how this new interest would fit into my life, I was thrilled about the unknown possibilities. I could no longer ignore the dull ache in my heart telling me that I was on the wrong career path, in a corporate field that was not my real passion. I had found something I was incredibly passionate about: learning more and more about how food itself is medicine and a powerful tool for achieving our highest beauty.<br><br>Once I came to realize what I truly wanted, the flame was lit and inspiration shifted into action. I was in a serious long-distance relationship with someone back home, but I knew deep down that it wasn't right. Within one week I quit my job, declined law school for the following fall, broke my apartment lease on Bondi Beach and dumped my boyfriend. There was no turning back now!<br><br>I walked into an STA travel office and, with a few thousand dollars saved from working, bought an around-the-world ticket with fifteen stops across five continents. At first I thought I might travel for two or three weeks, but once I started out, I could not stop. The more I learned and saw, the more I wanted to explore...so I ended up traveling for a total of about three years to very remote communities, for dollars a day. I stayed in guesthouses, ashrams, my tent (for many months across Africa), bungalows, on floors (even a few times on the floors of Asian Laundromats), and sometimes in bus and train stations with my backpack strapped to my body. I started out alone but sporadically met up with old friends and constantly met new people along the way as I weaved my way through Laos, China, Mongolia, Nepal, India, Swaziland, Indonesia, New Zealand, Cambodia, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Croatia, Peru, Malaysia, Botswana...over fifty countries in all.<br><br>My adventures were at times rough, dirty and even dangerous (though nothing really bad ever happened), but the truth is that I gleaned an incredible education from my three-year around-the-world journey. All these diverse countries had one thing in common: they had their own secrets to health and beauty. Each had an impact on my perspective on health, and in each country I deepened my understanding of true beauty and learned powerful beauty tips I still treasure today.<br><br>Thailand was the first country I ventured to after I left Australia, and it marked my initial immersion in the wonderful world of ancient and beautifying Asian fruits, especially the legendary durian. I feasted on the abundance of local fruit, and it composed a good 70 percent of my diet. It was then that I began my lifelong obsession with young coconuts, eating them every day, and like many Thais, I began using coconut oil on my hair and my body. Acquainting myself with all the culturally important fruits made me feel closely connected to the earth there, as well as to the warm, friendly and deeply Buddhist Thai people. When I came back to the United States, I continued to study coconuts and discovered that coconut oil is amazingly beautifying: it is cholesterol free and rich in medium-chain good fats that nourish the skin.<br><br>Hunan Province, tucked away in southwest China and home to many hill-tribe villages, is another one of my favorite parts of the world. I spent several weeks bicycling across rice paddies and sleeping on the floor of rooms in guesthouses, covered by mosquito nets. I noticed that the women with beautiful, glowing skin there consumed goji berries, no dairy, very small portions of meat and lots of local vegetables. I became fascinated with the depth of natural health knowledge so prevalent in China's culture, including its focus on ancient medicinal herbs and ways to enhance the chi (or life force) of the body by treating it as a holistic unit, rather than treating only one organ at a time.<br><br>My time in the Himalayas, which included months in Nepal, Kashmir and other parts of northern India, was simply magical. It was there that I first discovered yoga, which would have a lifelong impact on me. I also enjoyed greater exposure to Ayurvedic teachings and, in particular, became fascinated with the spice turmeric, which was first given to me by a tiny elderly woman as wrinkled as a raisin who ran an Ayurvedic healing center in a mountain nook. The turmeric really helped give my skin a vibrant glow. I was thrilled to discover other natural plants that can truly clean the blood and enhance the skin. I loved the spirit of the people of India, and to this day it remains one of my favorite countries.<br><br>When I finally made my way to Africa, I was mesmerized by the gorgeous, velvety skin of African women. From teenagers to women well into their sixties, they had poreless and perfectly moisturized complexions, without a zit or wrinkle in sight. I discovered that in countries like Ethiopia they use raw shea butter on their skin, which comes from a native nut and is scraped out fresh. It furthered my belief that pure and natural moisturizers are far superior to synthetic, petroleum-based ones, which most women in the Western world use. Diet issues aside, I realized that with our plethora of eye creams, serums, sunscreens and thick, heavy night creams, American women are <em>suffocating </em>their skin. I decided right then that I would take the cue from African women and use natural skin products that truly nourish the skin and allow it to breathe.<br><br>When I came back from my world journey, it was not easy for me to integrate back into American life. I was trying to put it all together and figure out how to combine my passion for skin care, health and nutrition. The first thing I did was get a job at one of the biggest beauty companies in the world. I wanted an inside glimpse into the beauty world to see if I could use my experiences there. But big corporate beauty was definitely not for me. I did, however, get a great education about the industry, and I learned some tricks of the trade that provided me with a foundation from which to make my dream of running my own company a reality.<br><br></p><h2>Chord Progressions For Songwriters</h2><p>Each chapter of Chord Progressions For Songwriters provides a comprehensive self-contained lesson on one of twenty-one popular chord progressions that every songwriter should know inside and out.Lessons cover ascending, basic (I-IV), blues, circle (VI-II-V-I), classic rock (I-bVII-IV), combination, descending, doo-wop (I-VIm-IV-V), ending, flamenco (Im-bVII-bVI-V), folk (I-V), introduction, jazz (IIm-V-I), minor blues, one-chord, pedal point, rock and roll (I-IV-V), standard (I-VIm-IIm-V), and turnaround progressions as well as rhythm and Coltrane changes.You will learn how key, duration, substitution, variation (adding or subtracting chords), and displacement (rearranged chord orders) are used to vary the sound of each progression.

Fools have been called "noodleheads" for centuries, but until recently few have represented the term quite so literally. Mac and Mac aren't the brightest pieces of pasta in the world, but their hearts are in the right place. Here, the two decide to help their mama out by gathering firewood in hopes that she'll bake them a cake. As they are attempting to cut the very branch they're sitting on, a passing meatball points out that they are mere minutes away from bruised bottoms. When his words come to pass, our heroes decide the meatball is clairvoyant and demand to know their future. Drawing on and smoothly weaving together a variety of folk tales, the brief graphic novel describes how its obtuse protagonists single-mindedly seek cake, even as they anticipate death, purchase "firewood seeds" (aka acorns), and accidentally dig their mother a garden. Emergent readers will appreciate the simple text, short chapters, and comics-inspired paneled illustrations. Adults will appreciate the authors' note, which goes into some detail about each chapter's folk origins. Two delightfully dense heroes bring folk tales into the 21st century, and young readers are all the richer for it. (Graphic early reader. 5-9)&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Kirkus Reviews</b><b></b><b></b><br><br><b>* (Starred Review)</b>K-Gr 3 "The creator of Fly Guy follows up Noodlehead Nightmares with another hilarious and engaging anthropomorphic book full of wacky slapstick. Brothers Mac and Mac are the titular heroes, and, yes, they are literally pieces of pasta. They are also, well, noodleheads: the literal-minded brothers are incapable of understanding metaphor or grasping simple concepts. The humor is similar to that in the Amelia Bedelia series, and youngsters will laugh knowingly at the noodleheads ridiculous antics as they bumble their way through to a happy conclusion. The author's note explains the worldwide tradition of tales of fools, their use in helping children learn logical thinking, and the specific stories that inspired the noodleheads' adventures. The cartoonish artwork captures the over-the-top feeling of the narrative perfectly. Children will doubtless ask for more titles starring the hapless brothers.

And every time Dad screeched round another bend, Pradeep turned a deeper shade of green. We were on our way to the vacation place that Dad had booked. Usually only Dad, my Evil Scientist big brother Mark, Pradeep&#x2019;s dad and his evil computer-genius big brother Sanj went on the Big Summer Weekend. But this year Sanj was at computer camp, and for the first time Dad said me and Pradeep were old enough to come. Nothing was going to wreck this weekend! <br>Not Pradeep, who was just about to hurl for the fifth time in four hours (I could tell because he had that surprised look on his face again). Not Sami, Pradeep&#x2019;s three-year-old sister, who had to come with us because as soon as our moms heard Pradeep and I were going away too, they booked themselves on a Massage and Mud Pack weekend. (Which I didn&#x2019;t understand at all. Moms hate mud on your shoes. They <i>really</i> hate mud on the living room carpet. But apparently they love it on their faces. Who knew?) This weekend wouldn&#x2019;t even be ruined by Mark not saying a word to me since he found out that Pradeep, Sami, and I were coming. If only he wouldn&#x2019;t thump me too, then it would be perfect. <br>&#x201c;Bag,&#x201d; Pradeep mumbled as we went over a bump in the road. <br>&#x201c;Bag,&#x201d; I said to Sami as she bounced in her car seat next to me. She passed me one of the stack of airplane sick bags that Pradeep&#x2019;s mom had packed for him for the journey. I unfolded it and passed it to Pradeep. Pradeep&#x2019;s mom gets these super-strong sick bags off the Internet because they can hold loads without breaking. They make the best splat bombs ever &#x2019;cause they never burst until they hit their target. It seemed a shame to waste them on actual car sickness. But a kid&#x2019;s gotta do what a kid&#x2019;s gotta do. <br>&#x201c;Bleeech!&#x201d; Pradeep filled the sick bag and then stared out the window. <br>&#x201c;Are we there yet? Are we there yet?&#x201d; Sami sang from her seat. <br>Dad looked straight ahead at the winding road. &#x201c;About twenty minutes maybe,&#x201d; he said. <br>Pradeep&#x2019;s dad was looking at his smartphone. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s 13.2 miles exactly to the destination.&#x201d; Pradeep&#x2019;s dad could get a job as one of those GPS things in cars. He&#x2019;s got the perfect voice for it. You would totally believe that he knew where he was going, even if he didn&#x2019;t. I don&#x2019;t think he would fit on the dashboard though. <br>&#x201c;If you look toward the sea, you can see the lighthouse from here,&#x201d; Dad said. <br>Pradeep, Sami, and I all craned our necks to look. The lighthouse was tall and white like a swirly whipped vanilla ice-cream cone sticking up out of the sea. That is, if swirly whipped vanilla ice-cream cones had giant lights at the top of them. It jutted out into the bay so the water lapped against it. <br>Mark sat slumped in the back of the car behind us, flicking through <i>Evil Scientist </i>magazine. This month&#x2019;s cover feature was called &#x201c;How to Take Over the World in Ten Easy Steps.&#x201d; He had his earbuds in and didn&#x2019;t even look up when Dad spoke. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s awesome, Mark. An actual lighthouse,&#x201d; I said to him. <br>Mark shot me an evil glare. &#x201c;There is nothing awesome about this moron-fest vacation.&#x201d; He pulled his hood up over his head. &#x201c;You losers have made this the lamest trip ever.&#x201d; <br>The cooler that was under Sami&#x2019;s feet started shaking. I lifted the lid to investigate. The eyes of Frankie, my zombie goldfish, glowed green as he batted cans of Coke against the sides of the cooler with his fins. He must have heard Mark&#x2019;s voice and gone all zombie mega-thrash fish. He still held a grudge against my brother for trying to murder him with his Evil Scientist toxic gunk. Luckily, Pradeep and I shocked Frankie back to life with a battery, and ever since, he&#x2019;s been our friend and fishy bodyguard. I hoped Frankie would calm down soon. <br>&#x201c;Swishy fish!&#x201d; Sami shouted. <br>I put my finger to my lips and turned to Sami. &#x201c;Shhhhhh!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What was that, precious?&#x201d; asked Pradeep&#x2019;s dad. <br>&#x201c;Uh, I think she&#x2019;s just excited about seeing fish in the sea,&#x201d; I said, covering for her. <br>Sami giggled and I carefully closed the lid of the cooler. Safe for now. <br>As Pradeep and I looked out the window, we saw a thick layer of fog hanging over the lighthouse, wrapping itself around a barely visible sign. I squinted to read it.

CRASH!&#x201d; she said in an announcer&#x2019;s voice. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s the first player to hit a window on the big brick warehouse across the street!&#x201d;<br> It was late on a Sunday afternoon, and Mike and Kate were waiting in line to run the bases after a Baltimore Orioles game.<br>&#x201c;Well then, maybe <i>I </i>hit it!&#x201d; Mike said.<br>&#x201c;And if <i>you </i>hit it, you&#x2019;ll have to pay for the broken window!&#x201d; Kate said.<br> Mike shrugged. &#x201c;Okay, I guess I&#x2019;ll let Babe Ruth take that one,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But he can&#x2019;t have pancakes&nbsp; with Flaps!&#x201d;<br> Mike and Kate had come to Baltimore with Kate&#x2019;s mom, Laura Hopkins. She was a sports reporter for American Sportz<i>. </i>She had arranged for Mike and Kate to meet the Orioles star pitcher Flaps Palmer the following day for a pregame meal. Flaps was superstitious. Before each game he pitched, he insisted on having flapjacks for good luck.<br> &#x201c;I might not be able to hit as well as Babe Ruth,&#x201d; Mike said. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;ll bet I can keep up with Flaps when it comes to eating pancakes!&#x201d; Kate nodded. &#x201c;When it comes to pancakes,<br> you could keep up with a vacuum cleaner!&#x201d;<br>Mike smiled. &#x201c;Yes, but I&#x2019;d enjoy them more than the vacuum would!&#x201d;<br>Mrs. Hopkins and the kids had arrived ear- lier that day from their home in Cooperstown, New York. They had watched the Sunday- afternoon Orioles game at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. They also had front-row seats near the dugout for the next day&#x2019;s game against the Seattle Mariners.<br> Mike pointed to a long, eight-story brick warehouse behind the Orioles&#x2019; outfield. &#x201c;Actually, I don&#x2019;t think Babe Ruth could have hit one of the windows in that warehouse,&#x201d; he said.<br> &#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; Kate asked.<br> &#x201c;Because back then, the Orioles played in a different stadium,&#x201d; Mike said. &#x201c;Also, even though he was born right near here, Babe Ruth was traded from the Orioles to the Boston Red&nbsp;Sox halfway through his first season. Back then, he was a pitcher, just like Flaps.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bet that&#x2019;s why Flaps is crazy about Babe Ruth,&#x201d; Kate said. &#x201c;At the ceremony before the game, they said Flaps is a huge fan!&#x201d;<br> During the ceremony, a valuable baseball glove that Babe Ruth once owned had been unveiled. It was an old, flat, brown glove, but it was worth over $250,000! The Orioles were going to put it on display in a room near the gift shop for the first time before the next day&#x2019;s game.<br> &#x201c;Hey, look&#x2014;it&#x2019;s our turn!&#x201d; Kate said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to run the bases at a major-league stadium!&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I know!&#x201d; Mike said. &#x201c;This is awesome!&#x201d; He high-fived Kate.<br> A man standing in front of the Orioles&#x2019; dugout motioned for Mike and Kate to head to the batter&#x2019;s box. He wore a black-and-orange&nbsp;Orioles jersey and had a big bushy beard. On his baseball cap was an image of a large white crab.<br>Before Mike and Kate reached home plate, they heard the first few bars of &#x201c;Take Me Out to the Ball Game.&#x201d; The man held up his hand to motion for Mike and Kate to stop. Then he reached into his pocket and pulled out his phone, which played the song as its ringtone.<br> The man answered the phone. While he talked, Mike pulled a tennis ball out of the pocket in his shorts and tossed it to Kate. They played catch until the man hung up. He waved at Mike and Kate and pointed at home plate. Mike slipped the ball back into his pocket, and they ran over.<br> &#x201c;Ready to run the bases like a Baltimore Oriole?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;Are you two doing this together?&#x201d;<br>Kate nodded.<br>&#x201c;Stand in the batter&#x2019;s box,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Take off when I say &#x2018;Go!&#x2019; &#x201d;<br> Kate and Mike crouched down, ready to run.<br> &#x201c;Five, four, three, two, one . . . GO!&#x201d; the man shouted.&nbsp;<br>Mike and Kate took off like a shot. Kate seized an early lead as she and Mike raced for first base.<br> &#x201c;Mike Walsh has ripped another line drive deep to center field,&#x201d; Mike called as he ran. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s another amazing hit by this young superstar.&#x201d; Kate&#x2019;s foot touched first base just before<br> Mike&#x2019;s. They headed to second.<br> &#x201c;Mike Walsh is tearing up the base paths today!&#x201d; Mike yelled. He pulled a step ahead of Kate.<br> A small cloud of dust rose behind them as they rounded second. Kate seemed to find extra power and shot ahead again, but Mike caught up near third. They thundered down on third base and headed for home.<br> &#x201c;It looks like it will be close!&#x201d; Mike called out. &#x201c;Will Mike Walsh beat the throw? I think he will!&#x201d;<br>Kate zoomed toward home plate. She was a step ahead of Mike.<br>Mike made a split-second decision to slide. His heel hit the white rubber edge of home plate just as Kate&#x2019;s right foot landed squarely in the center of the plate.<br> &#x201c;Home run!&#x201d; she cried. &#x201c;I win!&#x201d;<br> Mike slid across home plate, leaving a trail of dust behind him.<br> &#x201c;No way!&#x201d; Mike said as he stood up. &#x201c;My foot touched first. <i>I </i>won!&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;No, <i>I </i>won!&#x201d; Kate said.<br> &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s ask your mom,&#x201d; Mike said. Mrs. Hopkins had been standing just behind home plate, watching them. &#x201c;Who won, Aunt Laura?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;It was very close,&#x201d; Mrs. Hopkins said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s possible that Kate&#x2019;s foot landed first. You <i>were </i>behind her, Mike.&#x201d;<br>Mike held up his hands. &#x201c;I know!&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why I was sliding!&#x201d;Mike pointed to the far side of the plate. &#x201c;I started sliding right over there, and my foot crossed . . . ,&#x201d; he said.<br> Kate and Mrs. Hopkins waited for Mike to finish his thought, but he didn&#x2019;t. Instead, he scuffed at the dirt in the batter&#x2019;s box with the tip of his sneaker.<br> &#x201c;Mike?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is&nbsp;&nbsp; something&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wrong?&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs.<br> Hopkins asked.<br> Mike ignored them. He dropped to the ground, dug with his fingers, and then tugged something from the dirt.<br> Sunlight sparkled off a shiny gold coin. &#x201c;Look what I found,&#x201d; Mike said. &#x201c;Buried<br> treasure!&#x201d;</p><h2>Getaway Girl</h2><p><b>New edition of GETAWAY GIRL includes a sneak peak of RUNAWAY GIRL, which releases on September 24th</b><br><b>This unlikely getaway driver never expected to help the mayor escape...</b><br> After a six-year absence, Addison Potts is back in Charleston to stir things up.

(Read and Wonder)</h2><p><b>"Pitch-perfect throughout, enthusiastic and confident. . . . Positively ducky all around." &#x2014;&nbsp;<i>Publishers Weekly</i>&nbsp;(starred review)</b><br><br>The young girl in this story may live in the city, but outside her window there&#x2019;s a river full of mallard ducks! She hears them as soon as she wakes up, and on the way to school she sees them upside down bobbing for food. Interspersed with fun facts, her enthusiastic commentary about her feathered neighbors &#x2014; what they look like, how they behave, where they nest, where they sleep &#x2014; pairs swimmingly with cheerful watercolor illustrations.<br>Back matter includes an index and a note about ducks.</p><p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Davies, a zoologist who has written excellent books for children about sharks, polar bears and owls, deftly tucks a range of duck facts into the sweet story of a girl who lives near a river filled with ducks... The setting looks like an idealized European hamlet. An elegant bridge stretches over a riverside park, and cyclists and church steeples dot the landscape. The unnamed narrator fits right in, stylishly clad in matching beret and scarf. But her friendly, down-to-earth vernacular is well pitched for the 6- or 7-year-old reader. No doubt, she will inspire others that age to visit and watch their local mallards.<br>&#x2014;The New York Times<br><br>Davies&#x2019;s young narrator builds an impressive body of knowledge about ducks simply by watching the birds that live on and around the river that runs through her town...The text, set in a beautiful typeface that recalls rippling water, is pitch-perfect throughout, enthusiastic and confident, knowing without becoming precocious. Rubbino&#x2019;s watercolors combine a sketchbook immediacy and economy with an appreciation for the ducks&#x2019; streamlined shape, handsome coloration, and placid and genial demeanor. Positively ducky all around.<br>&#x2014;Publishers Weekly (starred review)<br><br>The daily activities of a young girl propel the easy-flowing language full of ducky details. Perfectly placed additional facts in smaller and similar-in-tone text are included on each spread...While Davies&#x2019; text gently informs, Rubbino&#x2019;s mixed-media illustrations, done in a subdued palette of watery greens, grays and browns, truly impress... An ideal introduction to this familiar waterfowl&#x2014;readers will enjoy diving right in.<br>&#x2014;Kirkus Reviews (starred review)<br><br>A charming and informative tribute to the ubiquitous duck... The mixed-media artwork adds a sweet, old-fashioned character to the story. Created in a palette of greens and browns, the illustrations reflect the peaceful setting of the natural habitat in which these birds live. Like Robert McCloskey&#x2019;s MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS (Viking, 1941), this gentle picture book celebrates the wonder and awe nature can inspire in everyday life.<br>&#x2014;School Library Journal (starred review)<br><br>The easy-going, colloquial tone of the text makes the information surprisingly easy to absorb... Rubbino&#x2019;s watercolor paintings have a wonderful freshness and spontaneity about them, capturing the look and body language of ducks, while including details of physiology mentioned in the story. Beautiful, informative, and fine for reading aloud.<br>&#x2014;Booklist (starred review)<br><br>Rubbino&#x2019;s art, vigorous, informal splashes of color with the fluidity of watercolor and the sharp-edged smoothness of digital illustration, relies on piney greens and russety browns in an earthtoned palette that exudes the damp chill of a duck-rich river in a frigid season; the gestural treatment of the ducks conveys their motion as they flap and preen. With a take-a-closer-look emphasis on animals that many youngsters have in their own neighborhoods, this is a useful addition to Davies&#x2019; excellent early nature-study titles that both answers questions and brings biology to kids&#x2019; doorsteps.<br>&#x2014;Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books<br><br>In this nicely illustrated picture book, the reader gets more than beautifully detailed drawings and a little girl&#x2019;s story. . . .With careful reading, one learns about the pond behavior, mating, feeding, sleeping, and parenting habits of ducks. The illustrations&#x2019; muted colors and the finely crafted font help to create an atmosphere that mimics the smooth progression of the ducks atop the water.<br>&#x2014;Library Media Connection</p><h2>The Bible in 366 Days for Women - Purple Faux Leather Devotional</h2><p><i>The Bible in 366 Days for Women</i> (LuxLeather) Devotional, explores meaningful, core passages from the New Living Translation (NLT).

According to Osage tradition, women are not permitted to dance, but Maria&#39;s parents recognized her gifts and allowed her to break the rule. Then when Maria reached the age of twelve, her father told her it was time to choose between her two loves. Maria chose ballet. It was a decision that would change not only the course of her life, but the face of classical ballet in America. The fascinating story of Maria Tallchief&#39;s rise to become America&#39;s prima ballerina will captivate young readers.</p><p><b>Maria Tallchief</b> was America's first major prima ballerina and also the first Native American prima ballerina. She was born in Oklahoma in 1925. When the choreographer&nbsp;George Balanchine founded&nbsp;what would become the&nbsp;New York City Ballet&nbsp;in 1946, Tallchief became the company's first star. She was vaulted to international fame in 1949 for her performance in <i>The Firebird</i>. Her&nbsp;role as the Sugarplum Fairy in&nbsp;<i>The Nutcracker</i>&nbsp;turned that ballet into America's favorite. After retiring from dance in 1966 she was active in promoting ballet in Chicago. Besides being a patron of the arts, she was also a champion of Native American culture and remained closely tied to her Osage history until her death.&nbsp;In 1996 she&nbsp;received a&nbsp;Kennedy Center Honor&nbsp;for lifetime achievements. Maria Tallchief died in 2013.<br><br><b>Rosemary Wells </b>is the author of 120 books for children, including more than 40 about the beloved bunnies Max and Ruby. She travels all over the country as a tireless advocate for literacy. Wells was born in New Jersey to a playwright father and ballet dancer mother who encouraged her artistic bent. She worked as an art director and designer before illustrating her first book. She is the mother of two grown daughters, Victoria and Marguerite, and grandmother to four girls.<br><br><b>Gary Kelley</b> received his degree in art from the University of Northern Iowa. He began his career as a graphic designer and art director before becoming an illustrator in the mid-1970s. He has received awards from the New York Society of Illustrators, the National Booksellers Association, <i>Print Magazine</i>, the New York Art Directors Show, the Los Angeles Society of Illustrators, the Bologna Book Fair&nbsp;(Italy), and others. His clients include <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>Rolling Stone</i>, <i>Playboy</i>, <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, <i>Time</i>, <i>Newsweek</i>, <i>GQ</i>, Franklin Library, CBS Records, the NFL, the Santa Fe Opera, and many others.In addition to his professional work, he has lectured at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, DC, the Society of Illustrators, the San Francisco Academy of Art, Ringling School of Art, and Syracuse University, to name just a few.In picture-book format, Tallchief's story begins with her childhood on an Osage Indian reservation in Oklahoma, where she took her first piano and dance lessons. After moving to Los Angeles, her parents found excellent teachers for the young dancer, who loved expressing the music with her body and worked hard to fulfill her aspiration to dance with the best, the Ballet Russes de Monte Carlo. The book ends with 17-year-old Tallchief leaving for New York to follow her dreams. In addition to the people and places remembered from childhood, Tallchief discusses the gift of music, which she and her parents recognized early as a driving force in her life. The joint authorship may cause some readers to wonder whose words are whose, yet the voice of the text speaks with great clarity, dignity, and power, occasionally lit by flashes of imagery and memory. Equally powerful and well crafted are the illustrations in heavily applied pastels. Gary Kelley grasps forms with a cubist's awareness of the solidity of people and objects, then arranges them to make an effective representational picture in two dimensions. Despite the book's large format and many illustrations, the length of the text and sophistication of the artwork indicate an older readership than the usual picture-book audience. A stirring choice for children (and perhaps some adults) who take their ballet seriously. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i></p><h2>DeLorme Atlas &amp; Gazetteer: Michigan (Delorme Michigan Atlas and Gazeteer)</h2><p>With an incredible wealth of detail, DeLorme's Atlas &amp; Gazetteer is the perfect companion for exploring the Michigan outdoors.

They weren&#x2019;t paying attention. None of the adults around here ever did. Even when the body bag was carted out, on wheels, and the wheels got caught in a gopher hole in the lawn, and the stretcher knocked into the tree, and the sudden motion caused a whole host of birds to burst out of the branches, exploding into the blue over our subdivision, and I looked up after them, and the EMTs guiding the stretcher stopped and looked up, and all my neighbors who&#x2019;d gathered to see what the commotion was about looked up, heavenward, into the sky, even then they thought it meant nothing. &#x201c;So that&#x2019;s where the birds have been hiding,&#x201d; one of my neighbors said. Not one adult could connect it to the fact that Leonard was now dead.</p><p>I knew the birds were no longer hungry&#x2014;they&#x2019;d feasted and had their fill, and now they took off, every last one of them, satisfied. But the adults of Azalea Street, curious about the murder, seeing as it was the first since our subdivision was founded, gathered in knots on our landscaped sidewalk corners to talk. They were hungry for information and gory details. They should have looked out of their windows sooner. They should have been watching. We were.</p><p>Truth is, we&#x2019;d been watching out for our neighbor Leonard for years. Since we hit puberty, and for some of us, that was way early. Since forever and always, it felt like. Before we saw him bring that girl home in the dead of night, all we knew was that he&#x2019;d been trying to get his hands on us.</p><p>My house on Azalea Street was next door to his house, so I&#x2019;d say I got the worst of it, what with my parents always feeling sorry for him and inviting him for dinner on Sundays. The three of them would sip watery pre-dinner drinks out back by the bug zapper, and somehow my parents would miss how, when he apologized for his stomach growling, the object he had his eyes hooked on wasn&#x2019;t the cheese plate. It was me.</p><p>He said things to me sometimes, in the hallway while heading for the guest bathroom. Did I have a boyfriend yet? Did I ever happen to try the kind of kissing that used tongue? Then he&#x2019;d shuffle away, fast, making me question what I&#x2019;d heard. When I caught him looking at me later, over the pear tart he&#x2019;d brought from next door, or over the sugar-dusted strudel, I saw his round black glasses go dim with sweat and fog.</p><p>Other girls had run-ins with him too. Some of our fathers and stepfathers used to work with Leonard at the plant, before he got downsized and they got to keep their jobs, so they said we had to be civil. Even kind. Our mothers and stepmothers appreciated how he&#x2019;d bring something fresh-baked for potlucks and fund-raisers, like a Bundt cake or a still-warm pie. None of our parents saw what we could see, which had us decide that growing up into adulthood must mean going blind.</p><p>Teenage girls know more than we&#x2019;re given credit for. We sense danger even when everyone&#x2019;s telling us it&#x2019;s fine, he&#x2019;s a perfectly nice man, an upstanding member of our community, have you <i>tasted</i> his sugar-cream pie?</p><p>When Leonard&#x2019;s gaudy lawn came into view, we knew it was time to cross the street. Ever since he lost his job, he liked to feed the birds, and he hung lots of birdhouses, spilled lots of seed.</p><p>It seemed innocent from the outside, maybe. But out back, from over the white picket fence that separated Leonard&#x2019;s house from mine, I could swear I heard the shots. Little pops in the air. I was never sure of it, never positive. But one time there was a squawk and a feathered eruption as a bird went down.</p><p>I can&#x2019;t prove he shot it, but I did see him hunching over it, kicking it with his enormous shoe. Other times I suspected he used poison in the feeders. This was slower and left them stiff, so when they fell from their perches they dropped to the ground like rocks. I found one over the fence on our side of the lawn once&#x2014;red-bellied and dark-feathered, its beak open mid-bite&#x2014;and I buried it in an orange shoebox, the most cheerful I could find, near where we made the cairn for Buster.</p><p>When the birds stopped coming&#x2014;not just to Leonard&#x2019;s house, but to my house and to the Willards&#x2019; house across the street, to Aggie&#x2019;s house a few doors down, to any house I passed on the way to the bus stop and back, all our trees birdless, all our patches of sky clean&#x2014;I guess he turned to other hobbies. That must have been when he bought the camera.</p><p>We&#x2019;d catch him standing on his porch, fancy long-lensed camera trained outward like he was waiting for a finch or a woodpecker. But with all feathery creatures avoiding his feeders, he couldn&#x2019;t have been aiming for the birds. His telephoto lens was as long as an arm and seemed suspiciously trained at the sidewalk. When Katie-Marie went past in her field hockey skirt, on the way to my house from her house so my mom could drive us to practice, she swore she could hear his camera snapping. She took off in a run.</p><p>The last time one of us was alone with him, it was Paisley. She said he cornered her in his kitchen and forced her to bake bread. Her mom had sent her on an errand, wanting one of Leonard&#x2019;s recipes, and when Paisley knocked on his back door, she found him elbow-deep in flour, prepping sticky coils of corpse-pale dough.</p><p>&#x201c;Why, hello there,&#x201d; he said in his deep baritone. His lips were pink and plushy and we didn&#x2019;t like to look at them when he shaped words.</p><p>Paisley told us she could sense the hunger coming off of him, like she was plump and roasting and he hadn&#x2019;t eaten for a week.</p><p>She heard a faint titter behind her, a lone bird that had lost its way in the treetops over our subdivision and drifted to the wrong set of branches over the wrong house. Or maybe it wasn&#x2019;t lost and that was a warning call. Maybe it knew what was about to be set in motion.</p><p>Paisley stepped inside his house.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;re you doing?&#x201d; Paisley had said. I would have asked for the recipe without going in, I would have told my mom to just get Leonard to e-mail it, but Paisley pressed her whole body into his kitchen and let the door shut behind her. She leaned forward on the counter, letting her long hair fall and her split ends dance. She took a finger. With it, she traced a word in the flour dusting the counter for him to see. It said <i>hi</i>. She was testing him. She was testing herself.</p><p>Leonard lit up. We imagined it wasn&#x2019;t often a teenage girl started a conversation with him voluntarily. He was pink in the face usually, but at that point he was bright red.</p><p>He began talking. He kind of couldn&#x2019;t shut up. He was explaining his method for baking braided bread, and then it became very important, essential even, to teach Paisley how to properly knead the dough in order to do it herself. She had to put effort into it, use all her strength and not hold back. It&#x2019;s just that she had such small hands.</p><p>On the windowsill, while this was going on, the bird was perched, black-eyed and unblinking. Paisley only thought it was weird later. Leonard was behind Paisley, very close, so close, she couldn&#x2019;t back up and get around him. She felt the bird watching. She smelled Leonard&#x2019;s yeasty breath.</p><p>We know our parents wouldn&#x2019;t believe us if we told them. Leonard was only <i>instructing</i> her. He was only being a <i>kind neighbor,</i> which in these times was a dying breed. That&#x2019;s what they would have said. They wanted us to have skills beyond phone-scrolling and one-finger texting, like knowing how to bake edible food in the oven and feed ourselves if they suddenly were dead.</p><p>But we believed Paisley right away. We knew he was too close. We knew how he pressed his front up against her to adjust her technique and how he breathed heavy, shaggy breaths against the nape of her neck. We knew how much he was enjoying this.</p><p>&#x201c;Knead,&#x201d; he told her in a low, careful voice. &#x201c;Go on, yes, like that. Knead.&#x201d;</p><p>He meant the slick mush in her hands, but Paisley had had enough. Out of all of us, she was the strongest, and that went far beyond her arm-wrestling skills against her brothers and the thick runner&#x2019;s muscles in her legs. She told us she&#x2019;d only wanted to prove he was a perv, prove it once and for all so there was no longer any question, and with this little bakery demonstration, she had won.</p><p>She elbowed him in the stomach and whipped a braid of wet dough at his rosy, stubbly face. She dodged him and was heading for the door before the dough was even on the baking sheet, before the baking sheet was even in the blazing oven, before the bread had risen, before it had browned. She was breathing fast. The bird outside the window flapped its wings in a frantic slap and took off.</p><p>Behind Paisley, there was a strange sound. A faint, high-pitched whimper. In a moment of weakness, Paisley paused and turned back.</p><p>He was talking, but his voice was different now. Smaller in his throat. Pathetic.</p><p>He only wanted to teach somebody something, he called after her. He was sorry, he said, he didn&#x2019;t mean to scare her, it&#x2019;s just that he led such a lonely life.</p><p>The door was open. The sky bare and blank.</p><p>Paisley held still in the entryway. She was questioning herself, having a peculiar moment of compassion. Sometimes she could be so very live-and-let-live.</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Paisley started.</p><p>Leonard pinkened&#x2014;or else he was standing in direct range of the oven light.</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe you should get a dog,&#x201d; she said at last. &#x201c;So you&#x2019;re not so lonely.&#x201d;</p><p>He looked down the length of his giant legs to his giant feet. No dogs, he said. Animals didn&#x2019;t like him for some reason. He shrugged.</p><p>Paisley smirked. She had a dark streak. &#x201c;Then you should buy a blow-up doll online and make her your wife,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I can send you a link.&#x201d; At this, his mouth gaping open, his cheeks full of flames, she took off. She&#x2019;d gotten what she came for: Leonard&#x2019;s sugar-cream pie recipe for her mother was already secured in hand.</p><p>But so was the thought of Leonard getting himself a girl.</p><p>It was Paisley, we&#x2019;ve agreed, who gave him the idea. He couldn&#x2019;t have her, and he couldn&#x2019;t have any of the rest of us, but his hunger was still there, eating at him.</p><p>It was days later when we heard his car pull into his driveway in the middle of the night. His house was one of the smaller designs in our subdivision and didn&#x2019;t have a garage, so we could see everything from my bedroom window. There was nowhere he could hide.</p><p>Usually his car held only him and sometimes a tripod or some grocery bags. That night we noted the questionable shadow in his passenger seat. It was taller than usual. It had a distinctly human-size head.</p><p>Had he listened to Paisley and bought himself a companion? No. Our illusion was shattered when he circled the car to open the passenger-side door, and the shadow moved on its own and stepped out.</p><p>What he came home with that night couldn&#x2019;t be brought to life with a tire pump. She was already alive and breathing. We would have sworn she was real.</p><p>She wore a dark hood, and around it was a haze of fur, like she&#x2019;d just landed in our subdivision from the North Pole and didn&#x2019;t realize that, down here, it was spring.</p><p>The problem with the hood was that it hid her face. And her puffy coat hid the rest of her, though it did stop at her hips, and her legs could be made out beneath it. Even from my bedroom window next door, with a picket fence between us and the dark having fallen and the motion sensors not responding to the motion as she walked past where we swore they were. Even with all that, I could see her legs. Her legs were in black stockings, the kind with seams. At the end of her legs were little pointed blades that took to the pavement like ice picks. When she touched grass, her heels sunk in and she stopped and the light from the car door showed us one leg bent to retrieve the shoe. I wanted a leg like that. I wanted to grow up and look like that and have two.</p><p>Paisley was sleeping over. So was Katie-Marie.</p><p>&#x201c;Leonard has a new friend,&#x201d; Paisley announced. &#x201c;A <i>lady</i> friend. Did you know about this, Tasha? You knew, and didn&#x2019;t tell us?&#x201d;</p><p>I shook my head, unable to keep my eyes off the lady in the night. She&#x2019;d retrieved her shoe, slipped it back on. She was now standing still on the lawn while he was closing the car door. The fur trim on her coat rippled in the wind like a layer of black feathers. Her legs didn&#x2019;t fidget or pace or shake, showing no hint of nerves. Leonard was right there. He was <i>right there,</i> and she didn&#x2019;t run.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never seen her before,&#x201d; I said. I would have remembered.</p><p>But there was something about the way she moved. She didn&#x2019;t seem surprised by the clutter of ugly, vacant dollhouses meant to entice the nonexistent birds. She wove around the mazelike lawn as if she&#x2019;d been here before.</p><p>&#x201c;Is she tied up in the trunk?&#x201d; Katie-Marie called out from across the room. &#x201c;Is she bound and gagged?&#x201d;</p><p>Katie-Marie couldn&#x2019;t see the scene outside. She was lying on my bed, an arm draped over her eyes. Before we heard Leonard&#x2019;s car, we&#x2019;d been trying to psychically impress boys we liked into becoming our boyfriends by thinking about them with pointed intention and hoping, somehow, across the airwaves, they heard. Paisley had long given up on Georges, and I only halfheartedly tried to psychically seduce Takeshi because I was pretty sure he liked me already and I figured I didn&#x2019;t have to try so hard. But Katie-Marie really wanted Mike, and her forehead was all scrunched up with effort.</p><p>The power of the mind was something we experimented with on Friday night sleepovers. Also light-as-a-feather-stiff-as-a-board, and the Ouija, before Katie-Marie&#x2019;s dad burned it in her backyard. We also tried texting boys alluring emoticons and, on one brave night, posted photos of our faceless boobs to a message board, but then took them down fast when the comments got scary and promised among us that we&#x2019;d never show the photos to anyone, not even Georges or Takeshi or Mike.</p><p>After Paisley&#x2019;s visit to Leonard&#x2019;s house, we had wished harm on him and tried out our psychic impressions to make that happen. We realized it would be easiest if he just went away, so we wished him gone, like to Florida. Then he showed up for Sunday dinner like always, my father sharing a cigar with him in the garage, where he thought we couldn&#x2019;t smell the stink, and I had to admit our magical thinking wasn&#x2019;t making any magic. Leonard was still here.</p><p>All that seemed so juvenile now. Leonard had real live company, and we couldn&#x2019;t see who it was.</p><p>&#x201c;Leonard&#x2019;s friend is walking on her own two feet,&#x201d; I narrated for Katie-Marie. &#x201c;Leonard&#x2019;s friend&#x2019;s nails are painted&#x201d;&#x2014;I waited for it as she reached up to touch one of his gaudy hanging birdhouses, then recoiled like it stung&#x2014;&#x201c;ooh, black.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Paisley corrected me. &#x201c;Purple.&#x201d;</p><p>She was right. His lady friend had dark, deep-purple-painted nails, and they were long and curling, almost like claws. The hand seemed to lift up and out. It seemed to face us, to be motioning our way, like it was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. waving. Then the sleeve dropped and hid her hand from view.</p><p>I blinked.</p><p>&#x201c;She has very nice legs,&#x201d; Paisley said.</p><p>Katie-Marie finally opened her eyes and crawled...</p></p><h2>1861: The Civil War Awakening</h2><p><p>A gripping and original account of how the Civil War began and a second American revolution unfolded, setting Abraham Lincoln on the path to greatness and millions of slaves on the road to freedom.<br> &nbsp;<br> An epic of courage and heroism beyond the battlefields,<i> 1861</i> introduces us to a heretofore little-known cast of Civil War heroes&#x2014;among them an acrobatic militia colonel, an explorer&#x2019;s wife, an idealistic band of German immigrants, a regiment of New York City firemen, a community of Virginia slaves, and a young college professor who would one day become president.

Along with two other apprentices, Emi and Toumi, Risuko arrives to their new home, which is filled with lots of secrets. Risuko is a nickname meaning squirrel - and she has an uncanny ability to climb just about anything!<br>Not a lot of authors write about Japan and Japanese culture, although it's very interesting. David Kudler does an admirable job of describing sixteenth-century Japan, with tons of details to make the setting come alive. The characters are easy to relate to, especially Risuko. The women were portrayed as strong and independent, especially unique if one thinks this was set in the sixteenth century. The story was filled with action, suspense, and a unique, well-crafted storyline.&nbsp;<br>[...]<br>It is easy to invest in the characters, and once the reader starts this book, it's almost impossible to put it down. Risuko goes through a lot of character growth throughout the book. An entertaining story with excellent writing and haunting descriptions, a relatable heroine, and fast-paced writing. &nbsp;--&nbsp;Majanka Verstraete, InD'tale Magazine<br><br>In this YA historical novel set in Japan s Sengoku period, a girl who adores climbing attends an unusual school. Your mother sold you to me this morning. With this, young Kano Murasaki, called Risuko (Squirrel) for her love of climbing, learns she s to accompany imperious old Lady Chiyome s palanquin. Risuko s father was a samurai, a prestigious occupation in war-torn 16th-century Japan. After being disgraced, he had to find work as a scribe; he taught Risuko to read and write, but with him dead now, the family is near starving and Risuko s best option is to comply. The traveling party undergoes a cold and dangerous journey as it tries to dodge the fighting between rival warlords. Along the way, Risuko displays some of her abilities not just climbing, but calligraphy, bird calls, and presence of mind when attacked. When they finally reach the Mochizuki compound, Risuko becomes a novice, believing that she s being trained as a shrine attendant. There s talk of initiates becoming kunoichi, which no one will explain: you ll just have to find out on your own. At first, the novices perform only menial tasks, especially kitchen work, but they eventually receive lessons in music, singing, and dancing. But suspicion and intrigue (both political and romantic), plus attempted thievery and worse, tear apart the Mochizuki community, leading to a dramatic confrontation with the truth. Kudler (How Raven Brought Back the Light, 2014, etc.) draws on one of the most fascinating elements of Japan s feudal period the kunoichi, or female ninja. (Mochizuki Chiyome is a historical figure who trained young women as spies and assassins, using cover identities such as shrine attendants, servants, and prostitutes.) Also intriguing are the cultural details that Kudler weaves into his story, such as the Retreat, a small building where Mochizuki s women stay during their periods. The characters are nicely varied and all the pieces fit into place deftly, such as how Risuko s dance movements and kitchen skills can be used in fighting. A tight, exciting, and thoughtful first volume in what promises to be a fine series about a female ninja. --Kirkus Reviews</p><h2>The Berenstain Bears Love One Another (Berenstain Bears)</h2><p>Stan and Jan Berenstain launched the Berenstain Bears books in 1962 with The Big Honey Hunt.

They are, after all, horses. What could they possibly know about life and God that theologians haven&#x2019;t already written? But slowly she engages their language and listens to their holy wisdom, attending to how they express their being, their actions, and their relationships. She allows horses to draw her out of the faith of intellect and into a deeper faith of emotion, body, and soul.</p><p>With edgy honesty and humor, Brock invites all who have longed for a deeper spiritual encounter with God to join her in the saddle (and occasionally on the ground) to discover how horses speak of God and how their ways of knowing help us to discover ways of God speaking to us.</p></p><p>A former attorney, <b>Laurie M.

Her relationships with the horses she rides, grooms, and loves speak to our relationship with both the embodied and the transcendent. In the world of riding, some actions feel intuitive, while others require us to do what seems strange. We cannot grow without persistent practice, whether as riders or people of faith.

I felt very included by Laurie's book, both as a woman with her own spiritual life that is sometimes a challenging path, and as a&nbsp;horse&nbsp;woman and an&nbsp;Equine&nbsp;Facilitated Therapist. I found much wisdom, compassion, sisterhood and authenticity in the writing. Engaging with both horses and God is not an easy path and both will land you unceremoniously on your butt when that needs to happen and I so appreciated the honesty of that experience being shared.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Shelley Carr BA (Hons), MNCP</b> (Accred)&nbsp;www.equinesoulconnection.com</p><h2>Goldy Luck and the Three Pandas</h2><p><b>A favorite fairy tale set in a bustling contemporary Chinatown.</b><br><br>It's Chinese New Year, and Goldy Luck&#x2019;s mother wants her to take a plate of turnip cakes to the neighbors.

But Turtle is not as easily fooled as Anansi thought. Young readers will light in Janet Steven&#x2019;s bright and lively illustrations and laugh watching Anansi&#x2019;s plan backfire. <br><br> Based on tales originating in West Africa and familiar in Caribbean culture, the five-book <i>Anansi the Trickster</i> series is full of slapstick humor and mischief. Eric A. Kimmel's imaginative energy combined with Janet Steven' expressive illustrations create the perfect silly stories for fun-loving kids.</p><p>Eric A. Kimmel, having loved traditional stories since he was a child, has written, retold, and adapted folktales and legends from around the world. Along with <i>Anansi and the Talking Melon</i>, Kimmel has written four other Anansi titles, including <i>Anansi&#x2019;s Party Time</i>, which was awarded Bank Street College&#x2019;s Best Children&#x2019;s Book of the Year in 2008. Dr. Kimmel lives in Portland, Oregon with his wife Doris.<br> &nbsp;<br> Janet Stevens has written and illustrated popular books for over 30 years. Some of her titles include <i>Coyote Steals the Blanket: A Ute Tale</i> and <i>Tops &amp; Bottoms</i>. Her books include New York Times Bestsellers, Time Magazine Best Books of the Year, ALA Notable books, and a Caldecott Honor. She is most proud of her numerous state book awards that were voted on by young readers. She has two children and lives in Boulder, Colorado.Kindergarten-Grade 2-- In a companion volume to Anansi and the Moss Covered Rock (Holiday, 1990), Kimmel and Stevens team up again to extend the humor of a trickster tale from Africa. Anansi joins Turtle on a fishing excursion, intending to con him out of all the fish. Anansi's stubborn selfishness proves to be his undoing day after day until, at last, he realizes the folly of his ways because he has been tricked into doing all the work and is still hungry. Kimmel has adapted Joyce Cooper Arkhurst's sparer version found in The Adventures of Spider , (Little, 1964; o.p.) transforming the fisherman into a turtle and judiciously exercising his storyteller's prerogative to add humorous details and lively dialogue that follows a repetitive pattern. Although the ending has been changed substantially from the original source, it is nonetheless satisfying and suits this variation of the tale. Stevens's watercolor illustrations feature bright colors and bold black outlines and range from broad humor to subtle slyness. She, too, has taken liberties in her interpretation by affording Turtle human trappings and consistently portraying Anansi as an unadorned spider. Together, the text and art combine in a fresh new version that is a fine choice for oral presentation or for independent reading. --Starr LaTronica, North Berkeley Library, CA<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>When Pies Fly: Handmade Pastries from Strudels to Stromboli, Empanadas to Knishes</h2><p>Following up on PIE SQUARED's slab pies, food writer Cathy Barrow finds more ways to use pastry dough deliciously with crowd-pleasing (and easy to make) galettes and small tarts, as well as empanadas, strudels, and knishes.

This compelling young adult adaptation brings her ideas to a new audience. </p><p>When America achieves milestones of progress toward full and equal black participation in democracy, the systemic response is a consistent racist backlash that rolls back those wins. We Are Not Yet Equal examines five of these moments: The end of the Civil War and Reconstruction was greeted with Jim Crow laws; the promise of new opportunities in the North during the Great Migration was limited when blacks were physically blocked from moving away from the South; the Supreme Court's landmark 1954 <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i> decision was met with the shutting down of public schools throughout the South; the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 led to laws that disenfranchised millions of African American voters and a War on Drugs that disproportionally targeted blacks; and the election of President Obama led to an outburst of violence including the death of black teen Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri as well as the election of Donald Trump.</p><p>This YA is written in an approachable narrative style that provides teen readers with additional context to these historic moments and includes photographs and additional backmatter and resources for teens.</p></p><p><p><b>Carol Anderson </b>is the Charles Howard Candler Professor and Chair of African American Studies at Emory University.

This is a fun new take on &#x201c;There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly.&#x201d; The colorful and zany cartoon art does a phenomenal job of capturing the absurdity and hilarity of this outrageous spin-off. A harum-scarum old pirate encounters misfortune at sea as he ingests one unpalatable item after another.

The digitally created illustrations are boldly colorful and delightful. Children will linger on each page, not wanting to miss any details. Although many collections contain numerous versions of this tale, this one is modern and highly appealing.

Written originally in the African classical language Ge'ez, the book tells the history of a Davidic line of African monarchs, descended from King Solomon of Israel and Maqeda, Queen of Sheba (Saba), who journeyed to the Levant specifically to visit the wise and far-famed monarch. It was a successful meeting of minds, and Maqeda proved the equal of Solomon the Wise in a series of long philosophical discussions. But the Hebrew monarch was not merely attracted to the African Queen's intellect - by means of a ploy, he seduced Maqeda, who gave birth to a son, Ebna-Lahakim. But this seduction proved to be Solomon's undoing. While in Israel, Prince Ebna-Lahakim gathered around him a group of royal nobles and together they seized the two most powerful symbols of Israel's compact with the Almighty - the Ark of the Covenant and the stone tablets of the Ten Commandments. These trophies were carried back to Abyssinia where, it is said, they remain to this day.</p></p><p>A "great storehouse of legends and traditions" according to translator E.A. Wallis Budge, 'The Kebra Nagast' most likely dates back to the sixth century AD, and provides an alternative view of many biblical stories. <p> According to this ancient text, the kings of Ethiopia were descended from Solomon, King of Israel, and the Queen of Sheba; the Ark of the Covenant had been brought from Jerusalem to Aksum by Meyelek, the son of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba; and the God of Israel had transferred his place of abode on earth from Jerusalem to Aksum, the ecclesiastical and political capital of Ethiopia.</p>E.A. WALLIS BUDGE was the curator of Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities at the British Museum and he collected a large number of manuscripts.

Jack knows his brother and knows this couldn't be an accident; someone must have wanted his brother dead. But the powers that be say otherwise. As Jack tries to uncover details of his brothers last night, he confronts a barricade of lawyers, police, and paid protectors who separate the multibillionaire summer residents from local workers like Peter.<br> Soon he discovers that Peter wasn't just parking cars at the summer parties of the rich. He was making serious money satisfying the sexual needs of the richest women and men in town. <i>The Beach House</i> reveals the secret lives of celebrities in a breathtaking drama of revenge-with a finale so shocking that only James Patterson could have written it.<br></p><p>James Patterson and Peter de Jonge's <i>The Beach House</i> opens with the death of a handsome townie on Memorial Day weekend in the Hamptons, where being a single-digit millionaire is laughable and being poor is unthinkable. Peter Mullen is a high school dropout who parks cars at the private bashes of the superwealthy Barry and Campion Neubauer. When Peter is found dead on the beach, the Neubauers and their friends insist that he drowned, but his brother Jack, a law student who saw Peter's body, knows he was beaten to death. As Jack uncovers evidence of his brother's secret life, he begins to realize that the very rich are indeed different from the rest of us. Revenge is a dish best served cold, and Jack's patiently plotted payback for Peter's death is one that the Hamptons will not soon forget. <p> There are no big surprises in <i>The Beach House</i>, but it's vintage Patterson, with plenty of action, villains with hearts blacker than obsidian, and a working-class hero who pulls himself up by the bootstraps. Patterson and de Jonge previously coauthored the inspirational golf romance <i>Miracle on the 17th Green</i>, but this new game of money, mayhem, and murder clearly suits them to a tee. <i>--Barrie Trinkle</i></p>James Patterson has had more <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers than any other writer, ever, according to <i>Guinness World Records</i>. Since his first novel won the Edgar Award in 1977 James Patterson's books have sold more than 375 million copies. He is the author of the Alex Cross novels<b>,</b> the most popular detective series of the past twenty-five years, including <i>Kiss the Girls </i>and <i>Along Came a Spider</i>.

We can let them harden us and make us increasingly resentful and afraid, or we can let them soften us and allow our inherent human kindness to shine through. Here Pema Ch�dr�n provides essential tools for dealing with the many difficulties that life throws our way, teaching us how to awaken our basic human goodness and connect deeply with others&#x2014;to accept ourselves and everything around us complete with faults and imperfections. She shows the strength that comes from staying in touch with what&#x2019;s happening in our lives right now and helps us unmask the ways in which our egos cause us to resist life as it is. If we go to the places that scare us, Pema suggests, we just might find the boundless life we&#x2019;ve always dreamed of.<br><br>This book is printed on deckled edge paper.</p><p>Pema Ch�dr�n may have more good one-liners than a Groucho Marx retrospective, but this nun's stingers go straight to the heart: "The essence of bravery is being without self-deception"; "When we practice generosity, we become intimate with our grasping"; "Difficult people are the greatest teachers." These are the punctuations to specific teachings of fearlessness. In <i>The Places That Scare You</i>, Ch�dr�n introduces a host of the compassionate warriors' tools and concepts for transforming anxieties and negative emotions into positive living. Rather than steeling ourselves against hardship, she suggests we open ourselves to vulnerability; from this comes the loving kindness and compassion that are the wellsprings of joy. How do we achieve it? Through meditation, mindfulness, slogans, aspiration, and several other practices, such as <i>tonglen</i>, which is taking in the pain and suffering of others while sending out happiness to all--emphasis on the <i>all</i>. Ch�dr�n introduces each of these practices in turn, backing them up with succinct practical reasoning and a framework of ideas that offers fresh interpretations of familiar words like <i>strength</i>, <i>laziness</i>, and <i>groundlessness</i>. Ch�dr�n is the type of person you'd like to have with you in an emergency, and to deal with the extremes of daily life. In her absence, <i>The Places That Scare You</i> will do nicely. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Our first response to troubled emotions is to distance ourselves from the pain. But true healing comes from doing just the opposite. In this inspiring new program, beloved Buddhist teacher Pema Chvdrvn teaches us how to embrace vulnerability and the &#34;soft&#34; feeling that lives in the center of our hearts to ignite our inborn bodhichitta - our power of compassion for ourselves and others. Includes basic instruction in core Buddhist teachings.</p><h2>Richard Scarry&#39;s Naughty Bunny (Little Golden Book)</h2><p><b><i>Richard Scarry's Naughty Bunny</i> is now back in print as a Little Golden Book!</b><br><br>Beloved Richard Scarry has created one of his most endearingly naughty characters ever.

After five years of drawing maps and designing graphics for the US Army, he moved to New York to pursue a career in commercial art. But after showing his portfolio to one of the original editors at Golden Books, he found the perfect home for his work. The assignments first given to Scarry tended to be Little Golden Books that featured popular characters of the day, such as Winky Dink, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, and Smokey the Bear. Eventually Scarry created many original characters, such as Lowly Worm and Huckle Cat. But first came Nicholas, a young rabbit clad in red overalls, for the now-iconic board book&nbsp;<i>I Am a Bunny</i>.&nbsp;<br><br>In his extraordinary career, Richard Scarry illustrated more than 150 books, many of which have never been out of print.

Each night she and her teacher, Thin Elderly, visit an old woman&#x2019;s home where she softly touches beloved objects, gathering happy memories, and drops of old scents and sounds. Littlest One pieces these bits together and presents them to her sleeping human in the form of pleasant dreams. But the dreaded Sinisteeds, dark fearsome creatures that plague their victims with nightmares, are always at work against the dreamgivers. When the old woman takes in John, an angry foster child with a troubled past, the Sinisteeds go after him with their horrifying nightmares.

Somewhere nearby, heavy wings swooped and a young rabbit, captured by sharp talons,&nbsp;shrieked as he was lifted to his doom. Startled, a raccoon looked up with bright eyes from the place where he was foraging. Two deer moved in tandem through a meadow. A thin cloud slid across the moon.<br> ~~~<br> The pair crept stealthily through the small house. Night was their time of work, the time when human conversation had ceased, when thoughts had drifted away and even breathing and heartbeats had slowed. The outdoors was awake and stirring but the little house was dark and silent.<br> They tiptoed, and whispered. Unaware, the woman and her dog slept soundly, though the dog, on his pillow bed of cedar shavings at the foot of the woman's four-poster, moved his legs now and then as if chasing a dream rabbit.<br> "Are we a kind of dog?" Littlest One asked suddenly.<br> "Shhh."<br> They crept through the bedroom, out into the dark hall.<br> "May I talk now?"<br> "Oh, all right. Very quietly, though."<br> "I asked if we are a kind of dog."<br> Littlest One, whose name was sometimes shortened affectionately to simply Littlest, was&nbsp;working on this night with Fastidious, the one who had been designated her teacher. Littlest was very small, new to the work, energetic and curious. Fastidious was tired, impatient, and had a headache. She sniffed in exasperation.<br> "Whatever makes you ask&nbsp;such a thing? The other learners never ask questions like that."<br> "That's because they don't take time to think about things. I'm a thinker. Right now I'm thinking about whether I am a kind of dog."<br> "You just tiptoed past one. What did you notice about him?"<br> Littlest One thought. "A slight snore, a whiff of doggy breath, and his upper lip was folded under by mistake, just above a big tooth. It gave him an odd expression."<br> "Does he resemble us in the least?"<br> Littlest pondered. "No. But I believe there are many kinds of dogs. We saw that book, remember."<br> "Hurry along," Fastidious said. "There's much to do, and we have to go down the stairs yet."<br> Littlest One hurried along. The stairs were difficult, and she had to concentrate.<br> "You do remember the book,&nbsp;don't you? Ouch!" She had stumbled a bit.<br> "Grasp the carpet fibers. Look how I'm doing it."<br> "Couldn't we flutter down?"<br> "We can't waste our flutters. They use up energy."<br> They both made their way carefully down. "I hear there are houses that have no&nbsp;stairs," Fastidious murmured in an irritated tone. "None at all. I sometimes wish that I had not been assigned this particular house."&nbsp;<br> Littlest looked around when they reached the bottom of the stairs. She could see now into the large room with the verycolorful rug. The small-paned windows were outlined in moonlight on the floor by the rug's edge. "I think this house is lovely," she said. "I wouldn't want any other house."<br> They tiptoed across. Littlest noticed her own shadow in the moonlight. "My goodness!" she exclaimed. "I didn't know we had shadows!"&nbsp;<br> "Of course we do. All creatures have shadows. They are a phenomenon created by light."<br> A phenomenon created by light. What a fine phrase, Littlest thought. She twirled suddenly on the rug and watched her shadow dance.<br> "Why is your shadow darker than mine?" she asked Fastidious, noticing the difference just then.<br> "I'm--well, I'm thicker than you. You're barely formed yet. You're practically transparent."<br> "Oh." Littlest examined her own self and saw that it was true. She had not paid much attention before to her own parts. Now she touched her ears, watching the shadow's arms move, too; then she swiveled her neck to peer down at her own tiny behind.<br> "I do not have a tail," she announced. "I think I am not a dog. We, I mean. We are not a kind of dog."<br> "There. You have answered your own question. Come more quickly, please. You are dawdling."<br> Reluctantly, Littlest scurried across the design of the carpet, beyond the moonlit rectangles, and onto the pine-boarded floor, which was always a little dangerous because of splinters.<br> "What if the dog woke? Would he see us? Or smell us, perhaps? I know he has a very significant nose. And if he did see us, or smell us, would that be dangerous for us?<br> "Or&nbsp;the woman? She woke the other night, remember? Because there was a bat in the house? It swooped and woke her somehow. She didn't like the bat. She was quite brave, I remember, and opened a window so the bat flew out into the night, which was where he had&nbsp;wanted to be all along, doing his night food-finding.<br> "But what if our little footsteps and flutterings had woken her? Would she have seen us?<br> "Are we visible to her?<br> "I know we don't fly the way bats do, but we operate at night. Might we be a type of bat?"<br> Fastidious turned suddenly with a very annoyed gesture. "Enough! Hush! Stop that questioning! We have our work to do. You insisted on coming. You said you'd be quiet. My nerves are becoming frayed. I want no more questions now. None whatsoever."<br> "All&nbsp;right. I promise," Littlest One said obediently. They continued on, one following the other.<br> "Are you doing your assigned tasks?"<br> "Yes. I touched the rug. And I'm touching this sweater now, the one she left on the chair."<br> "Gently. Do not under any circumstances press. But linger and get the feel of it into yourself."<br> "Yes, I am. You showed me how." Littlest was running her tiny fingers carefully over the sweater's soft sleeve. Then she touched a button and let her hand linger on it. It was startling, what she felt during the lingering. The entire history of the button came to her, and all it had been part of: a breezy picnic on a hillside in summer long ago; a January night, more recently, by the fire; and even, once, the time that a cup of tea had beenspilled on the sweater. It was all there, still.<br> They moved quietly around the room, touching things. Fastidious half fluttered, half climbed to a tabletop and methodically touched framed photographs. Littlest watched in the moonlight and saw how the fingers chose and touched and felt the faces gazing out from the photographs: a man in uniform; a baby, grinning; an elderly woman with a stern look.&nbsp;<br> Forgetting her promise of no questions, Littlest suddenly asked, "Might we be human?" But Fastidious did not reply.<br> &nbsp;<br><br></p></p><h2>Let&#39;s Study James</h2><p>Throughout the centuries, the <i>Letter of James</i> has proved to be an excellent refresher course in what it means to live the Christian life. It is only a few pages long. It can be read out loud in twenty minutes. It is very direct and extremely practical. Several themes run through the <i>Letter of James</i> and make clear what his burden is. He writes about suffering and joy, riches and poverty, faith and works, the tongue and speech, and about wisdom and folly. In a word, he writes about the heart and life of the Christian believer.<br> James s b�te noire is false and hollow piety; pious platitudes are anathema to him. Faith that does not issue in good works, a holy life, concern for the needy, and a disciplined use of the tongue, is for James no faith at all.<br> As with other volumes in the <i>Let s Study</i> series, the value of <i>Let s Study James</i> is enhanced by the Group Study Guide which follows.</p><p>Sinclair Buchanan Ferguson retired in 2013 as Senior Minister of First Presbyterian Church in Columbia, South Carolina, and returned to his native Scotland.

In <em>The Broken Mirror</em>, the first and most definitive book on BDD, Dr. Katharine Phillips draws on years of clinical practice, scientific research, and professional evaluations of over 700 patients to bring readers her expertise and experience with this often debilitating illness.<br>BDD causes sufferers to be obsessed by perceived flaws in their appearance and may afflict as much as two percent of the population, or nearly five million people. Many sufferers are able to function well in society, but remain secretly obsessed by their "hideous acne" or "horrible nose," sneaking constant peeks at a pocket mirror, or spending hours at a time redoing makeup. Others find their lives disintegrate because of their appearance obsessions. It is not an uncommon disorder, simply a hidden one, since sufferers are often embarrassed to tell even their closest friends about their concerns. The author presents the stories and interviews of over 200 individuals to show the many different behaviors and symptoms of BDD, and includes a quick self-assessment questionnaire. Four new chapters provide updated information on treatment of BDD, frequently obtained treatments to be avoided, and more detailed advice for family members and friends on how to cope with the disorder.<br>Left untreated, the torment of BDD can lead to psychiatric hospitalization and sometimes suicide. With treatment, many sufferers are able to lead normal lives. <em>The Broken Mirror</em> is literally a lifesaving handbook for sufferers, their families, and their doctors.<br></p><p><br><strong>Katharine A. Phillips</strong> is RI Director of the Body Dysmorphic Disorder and Body Image Program at Butler Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island, and Professor of Psychiatry and Human Behavior at Brown University School of Medicine.<br>"Dr. Phillips, our country's most experienced researcher and clinician in the area of body dysmorphic disorder, has written an impressive and very readable book that fills a gap in the medical literature. Clinicians and patients frequently ask what they can read to get a basic understanding of the techniques that have been successfully used to treat patients with this often disabling disorder. Until this book, there was not a comprehensive source."--Michael Jenike, M.D., Professor of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School<br><br>"Nobody knows more about Body Dysmorphic Disorder than Dr. Phillips and her book, The Broken Mirror, will be invaluable to patients who suffer from the disorder, members of their family who do not know how to be helpful, and finally, to the clinician who wants to know the latest research evidence regarding the effectiveness of different treatment approaches."--Dr. Robert L. Spitzer, New York State Psychiatric Institute<br><br>"Dr. Phillips' book is a landmark in the recognition and treatment of imagined ugliness. This book, beautifully written, provides a great deal of hope for patients with body dysmorphic disorder and their family members and should help speed recovery for countless sufferers of this common, fascinating, and disabling illness."--Eric Hollander, M.D., Professor of Psychiatry, The Mount Sinai Medical Center<br><br>"An important and seminal work. It breaks new ground. In addition, it is fascinating and fun to read. Hopefully it will help many people who have suffered in silence and in shame."--Robert M.A. Hirschfeld, M.D., University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston<br><br>"One of psychiatry's special gifts is, occasionally, to give a public name to isolating forms of torment. The Broken Mirror offers that gift, as well as reason to hope, to those who worry obsessively about their appearance. Katherine Phillips provides an authoritative look at an underrecognized and devastating disorder."--Peter D. Kramer, Clinical Professor of Psychiatry, Brown University, and author of Listening to Prozac<br><br>"Countless people suffer silently from chronic preoccupations that parts of their bodies are ugly or deformed--yet do not realize that these disorders are common and that highly effective treatments are now available. Dr. Philips, a leading scholar in this area, provides a definitive presentation of body dysmorphic disorder and its treatment."--Harrison G. Pope, Jr., M.D., Associate Professor of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, and author of New Hope for Binge Eaters<br><br>"If one thinks that BDD might simply be a new age coinage for vanity, Phillips...makes a convincing case for taking a second look by drawing on years of clinical practice, research, and patient interviews."--Book News</p><h2>The Birdy Snatchers: A Branches Book (Kung Pow Chicken #3) (3)</h2><p>This series is part of Scholastic's early chapter book line called Branches, which is aimed at newly independent readers.

It&#x2019;s more like a paraphrase. Rather than worry over the letter of the text, the goal has been to illuminate the large scale patterns that structure it. The King James Version, for instance, renders Paul&#x2019;s letter with uncanny beauty but is opaque as an argument. Modern translations tend to have the same problem. Their overriding concern is with the letter of the text, not with its logic. As a result, Paul&#x2019;s forest is always getting sacrificed for the sake of his trees. But Paul&#x2019;s work is too important, his good news too urgent, to leave so much of him locked in the first century. We need our renderings to do more than mimic the original, we need them to bleed and breathe. This work argues that the deep logic of Romans comes into sharp focus around a single premise: Paul&#x2019;s claim that grace is not God&#x2019;s backup plan. Paul never quite puts it like this, but he implies it at every turn.</p><p>Adam S. Miller is a professor of philosophy at Collin College in McKinney, Texas.

Full facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. This is Levi&#39;s first treatise on magic and was translated into English by Arthur Edward Waite as &#34;Transcendental Magic, its Doctrine and Ritual&#34;. Its famous opening lines present the single essential theme of Occultism and gives some of the flavor of its atmosphere: &#34;Behind the veil of all the hieratic and mystical allegories of ancient doctrines, behind the darkness and strange ordeals of all initiations, under the seal of all sacred writings, in the ruins of Nineveh or Thebes, on the crumbling stones of old temples and on the blackened visage of the Assyrian or Egyptian sphinx, in the monstrous or marvelous paintings which interpret to the faithful of India the inspired pages of the Vedas, in the cryptic emblems of our old books on alchemy, in the ceremonies practised at reception by all secret societies, there are found indications of a doctrine which is everywhere the same and everywhere carefully concealed. ( From the Introduction)&#34;. L�vi&#39;s version of magic became a great success, especially after his death. That Spiritualism was popular on both sides of the Atlantic from the 1850s contributed to this success. His magical teachings were free from obvious fanaticisms; he had nothing to sell, and did not pretend to be the initiate of some ancient or fictitious secret society. He incorporated the Tarot cards into his magical system, and as a result the Tarot has been an important part of the paraphernalia of Western magicians. He had a deep impact on the magic of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and later on the ex-Golden Dawn member Aleister Crowley. He was also the first to declare that a pentagram or five-pointed star with one point down and two points up represents evil, while a pentagram with one point up and two points down represents good. It was largely through the occultists inspired by him that L�vi is remembered as one of the key founders of the twentieth century revival of magic.</p><p>Published in French in 1854, �liphas L�vi&#39;s Dogme et rituel de la haute magie was translated into English by occult historian Arthur Waite in 1896. In this hugely popular book, L�vi outlines the theory and practices of Western occultism. The original two-volume French edition is also reissued in this series.Alphonse Louis Constant, better know by his pen name Eliphas Levi, was a master of the traditional Rosicrucian interpretation of the Kabbalah. He was born in France in 1810, and through the offices of the parish priest, was educated for the church at SaintSulpice. He was later expelled from seminary for teaching doctrines contrary to those of the Roman Catholic Church. In 1824 Levi began studying the occult sciences, and wrote about magic and the Kabbalah for the next three decades. His other books include &#34;Transcendental Magic&#34;, &#34;Mysteries of the Qabalah&#34;, and &#34;The Book of Splendours&#34;.</p><h2>Patents, Copyrights and Trademarks For Dummies</h2><p><b>Useful tips and step-by-step guidance from filing to issue to license</b> <p><b>Acquire and protect your share of this major business asset</b></p> <p>Want to secure and exploit the intellectual property rights due you or your company?

The stones fell principally on the home of Mrs. Margaret White, damaging the roof extensively and ruining two gutters and a downspout valued at approximately $25. Mrs. White, a widow, lives with her three-year-old daughter, Carietta.<br><br>Mrs. White could not be reached for comment.</b> <br><br>Nobody was really surprised when it happened, not really, not at the subconscious level where savage things grow. On the surface, all the girls in the shower room were shocked, thrilled, ashamed, or simply glad that the White bitch had taken it in the mouth again. Some of them might also have claimed surprise, but of course their claim was untrue. Carrie had been going to school with some of them since the first grade, and this had been building since that time, building slowly and immutably, in accordance with all the laws that govern human nature, building with all the steadiness of a chain reaction approaching critical mass. <br><br>What none of them knew, of course, was that Carrie White was telekinetic.<br>Graffiti scratched on a desk of the Barker Street Grammar School in Chamberlain:<br><i><br>Carrie White eats shit.</i><br><br><i><br></i>The locker room was filled with shouts, echoes, and the subterranean sound of showers splashing on tile. The girls had been playing volleyball in Period One, and their morning sweat was light and eager.<br><br>Girls stretched and writhed under the hot water, squalling, flicking water, squirting white bars of soap from hand to hand. Carrie stood among them stolidly, a frog among swans. She was a chunky girl with pimples on her neck and back and buttocks, her wet hair completely without color. It rested against her face with dispirited sogginess and she simply stood, head slightly bent, letting the water splat against her fl esh and roll off. She looked the part of the sacrificial goat, the constant butt, believer in left-handed monkey wrenches, perpetual foul-up, and she was.

Sue Snell had whipped a towel from her hair with the speed of a magician embarking on a wondrous feat and began to comb rapidly.

Congress (Tulane University Press: 1981), p. 34:<br><br>It can hardly be disputed that failure to note specific instances of telekinesis during the White girl&#x2019;s earlier years must be attributed to the conclusion offered by White and Stearns in their paper <i>Telekinesis: A Wild Talent Revisited</i>&#x2014;that the ability to move objects by effort of the will alone comes to the fore only in moments of extreme personal stress. The talent is well hidden indeed; how else could it have remained submerged for centuries with only the tip of the iceberg showing above a sea of quackery?<br><br>We have only skimpy hearsay evidence upon which to lay our foundation in this case, but even this is enough to indicate that a &#x201c;TK&#x201d; potential of immense magnitude existed within Carrie White.

They flew like snow and the chant became: &#x201c;Plug it <i>up</i>, plug it <i>up</i>, plug it <i>up</i>, plug it&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>Sue was throwing them too, throwing and chanting with the rest, not really sure what she was doing&#x2014;a charm had occurred to her mind and it glowed there like neon: <i>There&#x2019;s no harm in it really no harm in it really no harm&#x2014; </i>It was still flashing and glowing, reassuringly, when Carrie suddenly began to howl and back away, flailing her arms and grunting and gobbling.<br><br>The girls stopped, realizing that fission and explosion had finally been reached.

Yet there had been all these years, all these years of let&#x2019;s short-sheet Carrie&#x2019;s bed at Christian Youth Camp and I found this love letter from Carrie to Flash Bobby Pickett let&#x2019;s copy it and pass it around and hide her underpants somewhere and put this snake in her shoe and duck her King <i>again</i>, duck her <i>again</i>; Carrie tagging along stubbornly on biking trips, known one year as pudd&#x2019;n and the next year as truck-face, always smelling sweaty, not able to catch up; catching poison ivy from urinating in the bushes and everyone finding out (hey, scratch-ass, your bum itch?); Billy Preston putting peanut butter in her hair that time she fell asleep in study hall; the pinches, the legs outstretched in school aisles to trip her up, the books knocked from her desk, the obscene postcard tucked into her purse; Carrie at the church picnic and kneeling down clumsily to pray and the seam of her old madras skirt splitting along the zipper like the sound of a huge wind-breakage; Carrie always missing the ball, even in kickball, falling on her face in Modern Dance during their sophomore year and chipping a tooth, running into the net during volleyball; wearing stockings that were always run, running, or about to run, always showing sweat stains under the arms of her blouses; even the time Chris Hargensen called up after school from the Kelly Fruit Company downtown and asked her if she knew that <i>pig poop</i> was spelled C- A- R- R- I- E: Suddenly all this and the critical mass was reached. The ultimate shit-on, gross-out, put-down, long searched for, was found. Fission.<br><br>She backed away, howling in the new silence, fat forearms crossing her face, a tampon stuck in the middle of her pubic hair.<br><br>The girls watched her, their eyes shining solemnly.<br><br>Carrie backed into the side of one of the four large shower compartments and slowly collapsed into a sitting position. Slow, helpless groans jerked out of her. Her eyes rolled with wet whiteness, like the eyes of a hog in the slaughtering pen.<br><br>Sue said slowly, hesitantly: &#x201c;I think this must be the first time she ever&#x2014; &#x201d; <br><br>That was when the door pumped open with a flat and hurried bang and Miss Desjardin burst in to see what the matter was.<br>From <i>The Shadow Exploded</i> (p. 41):<br><br>Both medical and psychological writers on the subject are in agreement that Carrie White&#x2019;s exceptionally late and traumatic commencement of the menstrual cycle might well have provided the trigger for her latent talent.<br><br>It seems incredible that, as late as 1979, Carrie knew nothing of the mature woman&#x2019;s monthly cycle. It is nearly as incredible to believe that the girl&#x2019;s mother would permit her daughter to reach the age of nearly seventeen without consulting a gynecologist concerning the daughter&#x2019;s failure to menstruate.<br><br>Yet the facts are incontrovertible. When Carrie White realized she was bleeding from the vaginal opening, she had no idea of what was taking place. She was innocent of the entire concept of menstruation.<br><br>One of her surviving classmates, Ruth Gogan, tells of entering the girls&#x2019; locker room at Ewen High School the year before the events we are concerned with and seeing Carrie using a tampon to blot her lipstick with. At that time Miss Gogan said: &#x201c;What the hell are you up to?&#x201d; Miss White replied: &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t this right?&#x201d; Miss Gogan then replied: &#x201c;Sure. Sure it is.&#x201d; Ruth Gogan let a number of her girl friends in on this (she later told this interviewer she thought it was &#x201c;sorta cute&#x201d;), and if anyone tried in the future to inform Carrie of the true purpose of what she was using to make up with, she apparently dismissed the explanation as an attempt to pull her leg. This was a facet of her life that she had become exceedingly wary of. . . .<br>When the girls were gone to their Period Two classes and the bell had been silenced (several of them had slipped quietly out the back door before Miss Desjardin could begin to take names), Miss Desjardin employed the standard tactic for hysterics: She slapped Carrie smartly across the face. She hardly would have admitted the pleasure the act gave her, and she certainly would have denied that she regarded Carrie as a fat, whiny bag of lard. A first-year teacher, she still believed that she thought all children were good.<br><br>Carrie looked up at her dumbly, face still contorted and working. &#x201c; M- M- Miss D- D- Des- D&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Get up,&#x201d; Miss Desjardin said dispassionately.<br><br>&#x201c;Get up and tend to yourself.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;<i>I&#x2019;m bleeding to death!</i>&#x201d; Carrie screamed, and one blind, searching hand came up and clutched Miss Desjardin&#x2019;s white shorts. It left a bloody<br>handprint.<br><br>&#x201c;I . . . you . . .&#x201d; The gym teacher&#x2019;s face contorted into a pucker of disgust, and she suddenly hurled Carrie, stumbling, to her feet. &#x201c;<i>Get over there!</i>&#x201d;<br><br>Carrie stood swaying between the showers and the wall with its dime sanitary-napkin dispenser, slumped over, breasts pointing at the floor, her arms dangling limply. She looked like an ape. Her eyes were shiny and blank.<br><br>&#x201c;Now,&#x201d; Miss Desjardin said with hissing, deadly emphasis, &#x201c;you take one of those napkins out . . . no, never mind the coin slot, it&#x2019;s broken anyway . . . take one and . . . damn it, will you <i>do</i> it! You act as if you never had a period before.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Period?&#x201d; Carrie said.<br><br>Her expression of complete unbelief was too genuine, too full of dumb and hopeless horror, to be ignored or denied. A terrible and black foreknowledge grew in Rita Desjardin&#x2019;s mind. It was incredible, could not be. She herself had begun menstruation shortly after her eleventh birthday and had gone to the head of the stairs to yell down excitedly: &#x201c;Hey, Mum, I&#x2019;m on the rag!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Carrie?&#x201d; she said now. She advanced toward the girl. &#x201c;Carrie?&#x201d;<br><br>Carrie flinched away. At the same instant, a rack of softball bats in the corner fell over with a large, echoing bang. They rolled every which way, making Desjardin jump.<br><br>&#x201c;Carrie, is this your first period?&#x201d;<br><br>But now that the thought had been admitted, she hardly had to ask. The blood was dark and flowing with terrible heaviness. Both of Carrie&#x2019;s legs were smeared and splattered with it, as though she had waded through a river of blood.<br><br>&#x201c;It hurts,&#x201d; Carrie groaned. &#x201c;My stomach . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That passes,&#x201d; Miss Desjardin said. Pity and self-shame met in her and mixed uneasily. &#x201c;You have to . . . uh, stop the flow of blood. You&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>There was a bright flash overhead, followed by a flashgun-like pop as a lightbulb sizzled and went out. Miss Desjardin cried out with surprise, and it occurred to her<br>&nbsp;<br>(the whole damn place is falling in)<br><br>that this kind of thing always seemed to happen around Carrie when she was upset, as if bad luck dogged her every step. The thought was gone almost as quickly as it had come. She took one of the sanitary napkins from the broken dispenser and unwrapped it.<br><br>&#x201c;Look,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Like this&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><h2>The Smell of Other People&#39;s Houses</h2><p><p><b>&#x201c;Bonnie-Sue Hitchcock&#x2019;s Alaska is beautiful and wholly unfamiliar....

It&#x2019;s hard to hold on to a five-year-old dream, and even harder to remember people after ten years. But I never stopped believing there had to be something better than Birch Park, something better than living with Gran.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When I was sixteen Ithought maybe it was a boy named Ray Stevens. His father was a private detective and a hunting guide in the bush. His family had just built a new house on a lake where they parked their floatplane, and in winter they could snow-machine all the way down Moose Creek from their back door.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Stevenses&#x2019; whole house was made of fresh-cut cedar. All of Ray&#x2019;s clothes smelled like cedar, and it made me sneeze when I got close to him, but I got close anyway.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cedar is the smell of swim team parties at their house and the big eight-by-ten-inch Richard Nixon photograph that hung in the living room. Cedar is the smell of Republicans. It&#x2019;s the smell of sneaking from Ray&#x2019;s older sister&#x2019;s room (Anna also swam on my relay team; I befriended her out of necessity) and into Ray&#x2019;s room, where I crawled into his queen-sized bed facing the sliding glass doors that looked out on the lake. How many sixteen-year-old boys had a queen-sized bed? I&#x2019;m guessing one, and it had sheets that smelled like cedar and Tide, and they held a boy with curly blond hair, bleached from the swimming pool. He was the best diver in the state and I was only on a dumb relay team, but he sought me out anyway. We could have drowned in our combined smells of chlorine and ignorance--guess which part I was?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He knew how to French-kiss, which tasted like a forest of promises once I got used to it. Because I was Catholic, and smelled stiff instead of wild, he promised not to do anything but touch me lightly and only in certain places, where the smell wouldn&#x2019;t give me away when I went back to my own house, which held nothing but the faint scent of mold in second-hand furniture--also known as guilt and sin.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At the Stevenses&#x2019;, everything was fresh, like it had just been flown in from Outside, and there were no rules. Their shag carpet was so thick that in the morning I followed my deep orange footprints back to Ray&#x2019;s sister&#x2019;s room and pretended I&#x2019;d been there all night.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I only joined the swim team because ballet hadn&#x2019;t worked out. Gran was sure that any kind of dancing was just a slippery slope that butted right up to the gates of vanity. In her opinion, there was nothing worse than being vain. Lily and I paid for our vanity little by little. We paid by hiding good report cards, deflecting compliments, and staying out of sight. We paid in the confessional on Sundays. &#x201c;Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. I smiled at myself in the mirror today.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I did that. Once. Felt so good about myself that I smiled into a mirror and twirled and danced as if I held the world in my six-year-old hands. I was going to my first dance class in my fancy pink tutu and my long blond hair was all the way down to my butt. It really was so thick and long that it made this cool scritchy-scratchy noiseacross the mesh fabric of my tutu when I swung my head from side to side. It was the tutu Daddy had bought me Outside. You couldn&#x2019;t get a tutu like this in Fairbanks, and I don&#x2019;t think Gran knew that it was special, or she never would have let me have something the other girls didn&#x2019;t. I was so excited, and as I came up to the studio, I remember another girl and her mom going inside, too. Alyce was wearing a black leotard and plain pink tights. I could tell she was jealous, eyeing my tutu as she held open the door to let me in, and her mother said, &#x201c;You have the prettiest long hair I&#x2019;ve ever seen.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I know. I&#x2019;m pretty all over,&#x201d; I said to her without a second thought.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Alyce&#x2019;s mother smiled at me, but then her face changed quickly as Gran&#x2019;s fingers gripped me by the arm and yanked me inside. I didn&#x2019;t even have time to wonder what I&#x2019;d said that was wrong. Gran marched me into the bathroom, and said through gritted teeth, &#x201c;Oh, you think you&#x2019;re something special, do you?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She pulled a huge pair of orange-handled scissors out of her bag, as if she carried them around waiting for moments just like this. They looked like a bird with a silver metal beak. And they were loud. I can still hear the sound of my hair being chopped offwith just a few mad snaps of the bird&#x2019;s jaws. Then Gran made me walk out of the bathroom and go take my place on the piece of tape that Miss Judy put on the floor marking my spot. Nobody looked right at me, but there were mirrors onevery wall, so I could see their sideways glances. I could also see my hairsticking out in all directions, as if it had been caught in a lawn mower. No more swishing for me. I never went back to that class. And Gran never mentioned it again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Even after all theseyears, I know that a stroke of good luck, like a rich, popular boyfriend whose family likes you, means you just have to hold your breath and hope it lasts--and never, ever brag or feel too good about yourself.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That&#x2019;s why I stole one of Ray&#x2019;s white T-shirts and took it home to sleep with under my pillow so I could pretend my world smelled of cedar, too. No one ever suspected anything, because at Birch Park, where the sound of cockroaches chewing saltines is deafening, I just kept my head down and let Lily make all the mistakes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Bunny says we&#x2019;re poor,&#x201d; Lily announces as she and her best friend, Bunny, clatter through the door,letting in a gust of cold air. They drop their mittens and snowsuits into a big pile and trip out of their boots, knocking each other over trying not to belate for dinner.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Gran is reheating food left over after another Catholic Social Services luncheon. She works part-time typing for the archbishop, so we get first dibs on whatever food is left from their functions. Tonight&#x2019;s meal was delivered to the door by Father Mike himself, with his little white collar choking him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Selma is over and we&#x2019;re setting the table. I can see Gran looking at the food, wondering if it will be enough to feed two extra mouths. She reaches for a can of Spam to stretch it out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t say you were poor. I said you were poorer than me and Dumpling,&#x201d; Bunny says. Dumpling is her older sister.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I watch Gran sigh, which is a sign that we&#x2019;re aging her. We&#x2019;re always aging her, but especially Lily, and now Bunny is helping. Gran says if she didn&#x2019;t have to take care of us, she&#x2019;d still be a young woman. I look at her sagging boobs, then down at the tuna casserole. Too bad for Lily, there are peas in it again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What makes you so rich?&#x201d; she asks Bunny as they jostle each other at the sink, fighting over the Joysoap.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Fish camp,&#x201d; says Bunny, &#x201c;We get tons and tons of salmon at fish camp.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;My cousin goes fishing every summer,&#x201d; Selma chimes in. &#x201c;She doesn&#x2019;t think salmon are so special. In fact, Lily, I&#x2019;m sure Alyce would trade places with you--she would love not to have fish this summer.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Selma&#x2019;s cousin Alyce is the same Alyce from that fateful ballet class. It was her mother who told me my hair was pretty.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to go commercial fishing and have to live on a smelly old boat,&#x201d; Lily says, as if she&#x2019;s just been insulted. &#x201c;I want to go to fish camp like Bunny and Dumpling, near their village.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Bunny says, &#x201c;our camp is way up above the Arctic Circle. We have drumming circles and dances that go on all night, and then we lay our sleeping bags out on spruce boughs and we don&#x2019;t have to get up until the afternoon if we don&#x2019;t want to. Me and Dumpling get to shoot mice with BB guns and roast salmon hearts over the fire, too. Better than marshmallows!&#x201d; She rubs her belly and licks her lips just thinking about it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I&#x2019;ll pass on the roasted salmon hearts. But Bunny sounds braggy to me, and I glance over at Gran to see if she&#x2019;s ruffled by it. She&#x2019;s spooning food onto plates as if it takes so much concentration. I guess other people&#x2019;s kids can be vain if they want. Lily better watch out it doesn&#x2019;t rub off on her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Is there mayonnaise in this?&#x201d; Lily asks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She is the pickiest eater on the planet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Lily,&#x201d; Gran says in a voice that lets Lily know mayonnaise should be the least of her worries. &#x201c;Say grace.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Blessusolordandtheseourgiftswhichweareabouttoreceivefromthybountythroughchristourlordamenwhy-can&#x2019;t-we-have-a-fish-camp?&#x201d; Lily asks, without taking a breath.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Selma looks at me and we roll our eyes. Lily spends her life griping that almost everyone else in Birch Park has a fish camp. But saying it in front of Bunny puts Gran on the spot. It also shows how clueless both Lily and Bunny are if they haven&#x2019;t figured this one out yet. They&#x2019;re both eleven, which is plenty old enough know to where the lines are drawn.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t have a fish camp because we aren&#x2019;t native,&#x201d; Gran says, to her plate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not native, I&#x2019;m Athabascan,&#x201d; Bunny says.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Selma and I laugh.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s so funny? She is Athabascan,&#x201d; says Lily. &#x201c;Natives are the people like Dora&#x2019;s mom, the ones who hang out all day at the bar--they&#x2019;re too drunk to even bother fishing.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s enough,&#x201d; Gran says, slapping Lily so hard on the hand that her fork flies up and then falls with a clatter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;No more talking while we eat this meal that Father Mike has so generously provided for us.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lily pushes her peasaround on her plate. Her cheeks are bright pink.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fish camps are pretty much handed down from family to family, but maybe Gran shouldn&#x2019;t have lumped all Alaska Natives together. It didn&#x2019;t seem to make Bunny very happy. Especially because Bunny and Dumpling actually have the nicest parents in Birch Park. Dora&#x2019;s family never goes to fish camp. Lily knows better than to gossip about Dora at the table, though.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It&#x2019;s not as if we all didn&#x2019;t see what happened the night Dora came running out of her house wearing only a nightgown. Her father, Bumpo, was chasing after her, calling her a whore. Ithink he got the name Bumpo because he&#x2019;s always drunk and bumping into things. Bunny&#x2019;s dad, Mr. Moses, was the only person brave enough to go outside and face him. Mr. Moses had a big wool blanket and he scooped Dora up in it like she was just a sack of feathers; then he set her inside the door of his own house. No matter how much Bumpo yelled in his face or threatened him with a beer bottle, Mr. Moses didn&#x2019;t budge; he just stood there blocking the door that hid Dora.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It went on and on until Bumpo just sort of slumped over, all deflated. Bunny&#x2019;s father led Bumpo back to his house. And the rest of us went back to pretending we didn&#x2019;t see anything.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you&#x2019;re wondering why nobody called the cops, that would show how little you know about us. Whatever you happen to be--black, white, native, or purple, it doesn&#x2019;t matter--it&#x2019;s a sin to snitch. It&#x2019;s the one universal rule that being poor will buy you, for better or worse.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When Gran gets up from the table and is out of earshot, good old Selma leans in to Lily and says, &#x201c;I thought the Lord provided the meal, not Father Mike.&#x201d; All she gets is a halfhearted smile from my sister, who is busy piling her peas onto Bunny&#x2019;s plate now that Gran isn&#x2019;t looking.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bunny eats them all in one bite, because that&#x2019;s what best friends do. Then they both hop up saying they&#x2019;re going to Bunny&#x2019;s for Eskimo ice cream and are out the door before Gran can argue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lily has Bunny and I have Selma. And that&#x2019;s why we haven&#x2019;t gone totally batshit crazy yet, living with Gran.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Selma is the complete opposite of me. She came into the world in the most unconventional way and must have decided before she was even three days old that she was going to fall in love with her life, no matter what. (It helps that she doesn&#x2019;t live with someone who might chop off her hair.) Selma has these enormous brown eyes like a seal, and for whatever reason, she doesn&#x2019;t feel bound by the same rules as the rest of us, which makes her a great friend. But she doesn&#x2019;t live in Birch Park, and I&#x2019;m reminded of that when I hear a timid knock at the door, so light that Gran doesn&#x2019;t hear it in the kitchen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Selma&#x2019;s wide eyes are laughing around the edges as she mouths silently, &#x201c;Alyce.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Alyce will sometimes drop by and pick Selma up on her way home from ballet. They both live on the other side of the river, where the houses get nicer in a hurry and the rent is much higher.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Alyce is long and lean with high cheekbones. Her hair is pinned perfectly into a bun. She&#x2019;s wearing leg warmers, too, which might be fine at ballet, but in Birch Park I&#x2019;m sure anyone who sees her just thinks she cut the sleeves off her sweater and is wearing them on her legs.

And this fly is as bad as they come.

Having troubled the entire household and ``lit on the List'' of groceries (all of which turn up elsewhere), the fly ``Zzzz'''s onto a table where he comes to a just end: the baby drops the cake on him. Aylesworth's buoyant, rhythmic verse provides inspiration for a wondrous evolution of Gammell's style. Framing the book in dramatic fly-black endpapers, he intensifies his trademark rainbow colors, laying them on a white ground in vibrant clouds, flinging them in ebullient splatters signifying the mess and confusion in the fly's wake, and counterpointing the impressionistic setting with precisely observed characters and details: an outraged cat, Gramma's wizened face, the hairy, red-eyed culprit. Sheer delight for eyes, ears, and funny-bones. (Picture book. 3+) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

London. Milan. Paris. Fashion Week in all four cities. A month of endless interviews, parties, and unflagging work and attention to detail at the semiannual ready to wear fashion shows&#x2014;the famous pr�t-�-porter. At the center of the storm and avalanche of work is American Timmie O&#x2019;Neill, whose renowned line, Timmie O, is the embodiment of casual chic, in fashion and for the home. She has created a business that inspires, fills, and consumes her life. <br> &nbsp;<br> With an unerring instinct for what the next trend will be, an innate genius for business, tireless labor, and sheer fearlessness, starting from nothing, over two decades Timmie has built an international empire that has brought her enormous satisfaction and success. In a world where humility and compassion are all too rare, her humor, kindness, integrity, and creativity are inspirational. Yet as blessed as she feels by her success, Timmie harbors the private wounds of a devastating childhood and past tragedy. She is too smart, too experienced, and too hurt to want much in her personal life beyond a succession of convenient, very limited relationships. Always willing to take risks in business, she never risks her heart.<br> &nbsp;<br> But despite her well-ordered and highly controlled world, it turns out that Timmie O&#x2019;Neill is not immune to magic when it strikes. And it strikes in Paris during Paris Fashion Week, when an intriguing Frenchman comes into her life when she gets sick. At first, Timmie and Jean-Charles Vernier are only patient and physician. They become confidants and friends, corresponding at a safe distance between Paris and Los Angeles once she goes home. There is every reason why they must remain apart. But neither can deny their growing friendship and the electricity that sparks whenever they meet. <br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>First Sight</i> is as complex and compelling as modern life itself. Careers, families, histories, losses, duty, obligation, and fear of losing control and getting hurt. It is a tale of daring to take risks, and losing control just enough to have a life, when the opportunity presents itself. When two very different worlds and strong-willed people collide, everything changes in an instant, as they confront the age-old question of whether to lay oneself bare and risk intimacy&#x2014;or not. Are they brave enough to face what comes next? And will they do it together or apart?<br><br><b>Praise for <i>First Sight</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;A novel about love, in all its heartbreaking and splendid forms.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;Steel is one of the world&#x2019;s most popular authors, and this poignant romance is sure to thrill her many loyal fans and reach many new readers, too.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Booklist</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;Steel deftly stages heartstring-tugging moments.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></b></p><p><b>Danielle Steel</b>&nbsp;has been hailed as one of the world&#x2019;s most popular authors, with over 650 million copies of her novels sold.

She was exhausted after a week in New York, then two more in Europe, first in London, then in Milan. It was a pilgrimage she made twice a year in February and October for the ready to wear fashion shows the famous "pret-a-porter," where she introduced her new lines. She was the founder, guiding light, principal designer, and CEO of the most important men's and women's ready to wear lines in the United States, with subsidiary companies in Europe, which was what brought her to the European ready to wear shows twice a year. She showed her U.S. lines with the other American designers in New York. Hers was the only company that exhibited its wares in all four shows, both in Europe and the States. Timmie O'Neill had run her business _single-_handedly for _twenty-_three years, since she was _twenty-_five years old, when it all began. At _forty-_eight, her empire was so vast, it encompassed children's wear, home furnishings, and decorating accessories, including wallpaper, sheets and towels, and linens. Ten years before, they had added cosmetics, men and women's skin care products, and half a dozen perfumes, which had stunned them all with their universal appeal and almost instant success in every country where they were sold. Timmie O'Neill was a name that was known worldwide, and associated with style, fashion at a range of price points, and astonishing success. The world of Timmie O had been a legendary victory for more than two decades, and now its founder and CEO was heading for Paris to oversee the October ready to wear shows; of its _European-_based lines. The rest of the American designers wore themselves out during the frenzy of fashion week in New York, without adding the insanity of the European pret-a-porter. Only Timmie did both, with her boundless energy and legendary success. But even she was exhausted after Milan, and absolutely drained when she thought of doing the show again in Paris. The clothes they had just shown in Milan had been received with even greater than usual kudos from the press. For her entire career, it seemed, Timmie O'Neill had had a Midas touch, and could do no wrong in the eyes of the fashion world. Even during the occasional seasons when she had been less pleased with their lines herself, or the critics had been slightly less in love with them, they had done staggeringly well nonetheless. Everything Timmie did, she did well, she threw herself into all she undertook with perfectionism, boundless energy, and inimitable style and grace. She was relentless in how hard she pushed herself, far more than anyone else, and what she expected of herself. She had an uncanny knack for predicting what the world would want to wear, live with, and smell like, long before they thought about it themselves. Along with their clothing lines, their perfumes were among the biggest sellers in the world. She had chosen the scents and designed the packaging herself. There was very little that Timmie O'Neill didn't do well, brilliantly in fact, except maybe cook. And dress, she liked to say. As sensitive and forward thinking as her designs were, she insisted that most of the time she didn't care what she wore herself. She had little time to give it much thought, although the clothes she designed had made her famous, particularly her signature sportswear, which managed to be simul_taneously casual, easy to wear, and chic. There was a simple, clean _elegance to everything she designed, and without even trying, or thinking about it, she herself was the epitome of casual chic.<br> On the flight from Milan, she was wearing jeans, a T-shirt, both of her own label, a vintage mink jacket she had found years before in the back streets of Milan, and black ballerina flats she had designed the year before. She carried a large black alligator Hermes bag that had been the precursor of the Birkin, and was even more striking because of its size, and had real style because it looked well worn, after years of use on trips such as this.<br> The pilot announced their descent toward Charles de Gaulle Aiport in Raisey, just outside Paris, as Timmie stretched her legs out in front of her in one of the plane's eight _first-_class seats. She had slept for most of the brief flight and through the meal. She was wiped out after the pressure, work, and revels of Milan. The European ready to wear shows particularly entailed endless parties and socializing as well. No one ever slept till the end. There was a priest sitting next to her on the plane, who had said nothing to her during the flight, and was probably one of the few people who wouldn't recognize her, and wasn't wearing something she'd designed. They had nodded to each other politely when she took her seat, and ten minutes later, after glancing at The International Herald Tribune to see what they said about the collection she'd shown in Milan, and London the week before that, she was sound asleep. As the landing gear came down, she glanced out the window with a smile, thinking of Paris, and then turned to her two assistants, who were seated across the aisle from her. The priest had been happy to take the window seat, and neither of Timmie's _assistants had disturbed her while she slept. They'd all had a grueling three weeks, first at the shows in New York, then London and Milan. Paris was their last stop, much to their collective relief.<br><br> All four shows were important, and the ready to wear shows in Paris were always _high-_pressure, fast paced, and stressful from beginning to end. Milan was an important mecca of the fashion world, but Paris always mattered to her most. It always had. Paris was the city she loved most in the world, and the one that had spawned her dreams. Timmie still looked sleepy as she handed some notes to her assistants, David and Jade. David had been with her for six years, and Jade for twelve. They were passionately devoted to her for her kindness, fairness, and all they'd learned from her personally as well as professionally. Everything about Timmie was inspirational, from the genius of her work, to the thoughtful, compassionate way she treated people. David always said she was lit from within, like a beacon that shined through the darkness, pointing out the path for others. And the best of her was that she was entirely unaware of how remarkable she was. Humility was unheard of in the fashion world, but all who knew her agreed that she was amazingly uncomplicated and modest. She had a completely innate, instinctive sense about how to run her business, who she was designing for, and what they wanted to wear next season. She was quick to sense adjustments that had to be made, and never hesitated to make changes in the lines when necessary. There had been many over the years. She was never afraid to try something new, no matter how high risk. She was fearless in all she did. She lived life in bold strokes and had been a wonderful employer and friend to David and Jade over the years. Timmie was trustworthy, incredibly hard working, to the point of being driven, brilliant, creative, funny, compassionate, somewhat obsessive, a perfectionist in all things, and above all kind. She drove herself harder than she did anyone else. The standard she set for competence, efficiency, creativity, and integrity was high. She was merciless in her pursuit of perfection in all things.<br><br> David Gold had come to her right after graduating from Parsons as an aspiring designer, and Timmie had rapidly determined that his designs were prosaic and tended to lean more toward past styles that had been reliable and solid, but he had little of the forward vision toward the future that she looked for in design assistants. But she had seen in him something far different and more useful. He had a knack for ingenious marketing ideas, was supremely organized and attentive to details, and had an ability to keep vast numbers of people on track at the same time. She had singled him out of the design team rapidly, and put him to work for her as an assistant. He still came to the shows with her twice a year, but his responsibilities had grown exponentially in his six years with her. At _thirty-_two, he was a vice president in charge of marketing, and she reviewed all their publicity and ad campaigns with him. Together they had honed their PR image till it gleamed. He was brilliant at what he did.<br> As always, he made everything about the New York and European shows easier for her. Timmie had often said that his business card should read "magician" instead of VP in charge of marketing. The creativity he had lacked as a designer he had a hundredfold when it came to ideas about marketing, advertising, and handling people, in ways Timmie insisted she couldn't have done herself. She was always fair about acknowledging others' achievements and quick to lavish praise where it was due. She was extremely fond of him, and had nursed him back to health herself during a bout of hepatitis four years before. They had been close friends ever since, and he revered her as his mentor, and said she had taught him everything he'd ever learned about the fashion industry, while Timmie claimed he had long since outstripped her skills. Their team efforts were a huge success to the immeasurable benefit of "Timmie O," the company as well as the woman.<br><br></p></p><h2>The Yada Yada Prayer Group (Yada Yada Series)</h2><p><p><strong>What do an ex-con, a former drug addict, a real estate broker, a college student and a married mother of two have in common?</strong></p><p>Nothing, or so I thought.

They live in the Chicago area. Twitter: @ DaveNetaJackson Facebook: DaveNetaJacksonEven those who normally aren't drawn to Christian fiction should give this novel a listen. That's because much honored narrator Barbara Rosenblat puts new gloss on her sterling reputation in its narration. Rosenblat depicts a large cast of characters masterfully, in particular differentiating the multinational members of the titular prayer group. Moving easily from goody-two-shoes Jodi Baxter to her Jamaican, Honduran, and South African friends, Rosenblat illuminates a diverse group of women who bond by facing life's challenges through prayer. When Rosenblat dramatizes the prayers of an African-American member, the listener is tempted to shout "hallelujah!" Bravo to Rosenblat for transforming a nice novel into a notable audiobook.

A Welshman with a passion for the English language, Thomas&#x2019;s singular poetic voice has been admired and imitated, but never matched.</p><p>This exciting, newly edited annotated edition offers a more complete and representative collection of Dylan Thomas&#x2019;s poetic works than any previous edition. Edited by leading Dylan Thomas scholar John Goodby from the University of Swansea, <em>The Poems of Dylan Thomas</em> contains all the poems that appeared in <em>Collected Poems 1934-1952</em>, edited by Dylan Thomas himself, as well as poems from the 1930-1934 notebooks and poems from letters, amatory verses, occasional poems, the verse film script for &#x201c;Our Country,&#x201d; and poems that appear in his &#x201c;radio play for voices,&#x201d; <em>Under Milk Wood</em>. Showing the broad range of Dylan Thomas&#x2019;s oeuvre as never before, this new edition places Thomas in the twenty-first century, with an up-to-date introduction by Goodby whose notes and annotations take a pluralistic approach.</p></p><p><p>The Welsh poet <strong>Dylan Thomas</strong> (1914&#x2013;1953) was one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century.

Risking his life, he came out of hiding to fight against the Population Police laws. Now, in the final volume of Margaret Peterson Haddix's suspenseful Shadow Children series, Luke inadvertently sets off a rebellion that results in the overthrow of the government. The people are finally free. But who is in charge now? And will this new freedom be everything they had hoped?</p><p>Margaret Peterson Haddix is the author of many critically and popularly acclaimed YA and middle grade novels, including the Children of Exile series, The Missing series, the Under Their Skin series, and the Shadow Children series.

She lives with her family in Columbus, Ohio. Visit her at HaddixBooks.com.Grade 5-9&#x2013;This final installment in the set focuses on illegal third-child Luke, who has been working undercover in the Population Police stables with the hope of somehow helping to topple the oppressive regime. After being handpicked for a special chore by government officials, Luke and several other boys are loaded into a van and driven through the gates of headquarters and out into the world. All of the country's citizens are being issued new identification cards and they are told to knock on every door and summon the terrified people to a mandatory assembly. But one woman's steely refusal to comply kick-starts a revolution in which Luke is destined to play a critical role. Haddix's storytelling hums along quickly, if somewhat predictably. She relies a bit too heavily on stock dialogue and caricatures; change the name of the evil empire in command, for instance, and lines like The Population Police will prevail could have been written for any number of government goons in practically any futuristic novel. That said, this is a light, easy read that delivers what it promises. Fans of the series won't be disappointed.<i>&#x2013;Catherine Threadgill, Charleston County Public Library, SC</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Award-winning biographer Suzanne Finstad perceptively pieces together the clues from candid interviews with all the Presley intimates&#x2014;including Priscilla herself, along with hundreds of sources who have never before spoken publicly&#x2014;to uncover the surprising truths behind the legend of Elvis and Priscilla, a tumultuous tale of sexual attraction and obsession, heartbreak and loss. <br><br><i>Child Bride</i>, the only major biography of Priscilla Beaulieu Presley, unveils the controversial child-woman who evolved from a lonely and sexually precocious teenager kept by the King of Rock and Roll into a shrewd businesswoman in control of the multimillion-dollar Elvis Presley empire, a rags-to-riches saga of secrets and betrayals that began when Priscilla was only three years old.</p><p>With three steamy books by the women in Elvis's life already published (1997's <i>Elvis: In the Twilight of Memory</i> by June Juanico; Priscilla Beaulieu Presley's 1991 tell-all, <i>Elvis and Me</i>; and Joyce Bova's <i>Don't Ask Forever: My Love Affair with Elvis</i>), can the world absorb another? Suzanne Finstad, author of <i>Child Bride: The Untold Story of Priscilla Beaulieu Presley</i>, certainly hopes so. <p> With as many darkly intriguing details as the chambers of Graceland, Finstad--journalist, lawyer, and author of two true-crime books--defends her own theories on the complexity and grit of the former Mrs. Presley. Why did she conspire with her mother to keep her paternity a secret? How old was she when she took up with the King? Suzanne Finstad treats us to her own exhaustively researched version of the facts.</p>Suzanne Finstad is the award-winning author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Natasha: The Biography of Natalie Wood</i>, named the best film book of 2001 by the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>.

Who&#x2019;s up to no good? Nancy, Bess and George are on the case!</p><p>Carolyn Keene is the author of the ever-popular Nancy Drew books.Mystery of the Midnight Rider CHAPTER ONE<p></p> <br><br> Riding High<p></p> <br>&#x201c;IS THAT HER?&#x201d; I ASKED, SHADING MY EYES against the glare of the afternoon sun. &#x201c;The one in the beige breeches and tall boots?&#x201d;<br> <br>Ned grinned. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have to be more specific, Nancy. Just about everyone out there is wearing beige breeches and tall boots.&#x201d;<br> <br>The two of us were leaning on the rail of a large riding ring at the local fairgrounds. At the moment it was crowded with horses and riders warming up for their next class. All of them&#x2014;male and female, teenagers and adults&#x2014;were dressed almost exactly alike.<br> <br>&#x201c;You have a point,&#x201d; I said with a laugh. &#x201c;So how are we supposed to know who to cheer for once the class starts?&#x201d;<br> <br>Just then one of the horses separated from the others and trotted toward us. &#x201c;Ned Nickerson? Is that you?&#x201d; the rider called.<br> <br>Ned waved. &#x201c;Hi, Payton! It&#x2019;s good to see you again.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You too.&#x201d; Payton halted her horse in front of us and smiled shyly. She was about sixteen, with a slender build and delicate features that made her look tiny atop her horse, an enormous bay with a splash of white on its forehead.<br> <br>&#x201c;Payton, this is my girlfriend, Nancy Drew,&#x201d; Ned said. &#x201c;Nancy, this is Payton Evans.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nice to meet you,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Your horse is beautiful.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d; Payton leaned forward to give the horse a pat on its gleaming neck. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s actually not mine, though. I&#x2019;m riding him for my trainer&#x2014;he&#x2019;s one of her sale horses. He&#x2019;s still a little green, but he&#x2019;s coming along.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Green?&#x201d; Ned raised an eyebrow. &#x201c;Looks kind of reddish brown to me.&#x201d;<br> <br>I rolled my eyes at the lame joke. &#x201c;Green just means he&#x2019;s not fully trained yet,&#x201d; I explained.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201d; Payton smiled at me. &#x201c;Are you a rider, Nancy?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not really,&#x201d; I replied. &#x201c;But I took some lessons when I was a kid. And I never miss coming out to watch this show.&#x201d; I returned her smile. &#x201c;Even when I&#x2019;m not acquainted with one of the star riders.&#x201d;<br> <br>I glanced around, taking in the hustle and bustle surrounding me. The annual River Heights Horse Show was a prestigious competition, attracting top hunter-jumper riders from all over the country.<br> <br>Payton&#x2019;s smile faded slightly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not the star,&#x201d; she said, her voice so soft I could barely hear it over the thud of hoofbeats and chatter of riders and spectators. &#x201c;The horses are the stars. I&#x2019;m just along for the ride.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to be modest,&#x201d; I told her with a chuckle. &#x201c;Ned&#x2019;s told me all about you. He says you&#x2019;ve been riding since you were practically in diapers, you&#x2019;ve had all kinds of success on the A circuit, and you&#x2019;re super talented and hardworking.&#x201d;<br> <br>Payton shrugged, playing with the tiny braids of her mount&#x2019;s mane. When she responded, her voice was even quieter. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s easy to work hard at something you love.&#x201d;<br> <br>As an experienced amateur detective, I&#x2019;m pretty good at picking up clues. But it didn&#x2019;t take a supersleuth to tell that Payton wasn&#x2019;t comfortable with our current line of conversation. Time for a change of subject.<br> <br>&#x201c;Anyway,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;Ned also tells me your mom and his mom were college roommates.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201d; Payton stroked her mount as he snorted at a leaf blowing past. &#x201c;When Mrs. Nickerson heard I was coming to this show, she was nice enough to offer to let me stay with them so I don&#x2019;t have to stay in a hotel.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s thrilled to have you here, and she can&#x2019;t wait to see you tonight,&#x201d; Ned assured Payton. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m supposed to tell you not to eat too much today, since she and Dad are planning a big welcome barbecue for you tonight.&#x201d;<br> <br>I chuckled. &#x201c;That sounds like your parents,&#x201d; I told Ned. &#x201c;So are Payton&#x2019;s parents going to be staying with you too?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Payton answered before Ned could say anything. A sad look flitted across her face. &#x201c;They have to stay in Chicago for work today and tomorrow, and then they&#x2019;ve got a family obligation that will keep them busy for most of Saturday. But they promised they&#x2019;ll be here in time to watch me ride in the Grand Prix on Saturday.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The Grand Prix? What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; Ned asked.<br> <br>I rolled my eyes at him. &#x201c;Weren&#x2019;t you paying attention when I dragged you to this show last year?&#x201d; I joked. &#x201c;The Grand Prix is the big jumping competition on Saturday night. It&#x2019;s sort of like the equestrian competitions you see in the Olympics. Huge, colorful fences that are, like, ten feet high.&#x201d;<br> <br>Payton laughed. &#x201c;Not quite,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Even the best Olympic horse couldn&#x2019;t jump a ten-foot fence! The heights are more like five feet.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Close enough,&#x201d; I said with a shrug. &#x201c;Anything I can&#x2019;t step over myself looks high to me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ned poked me on the shoulder. &#x201c;Here come Bess and George,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I was wondering where they&#x2019;d disappeared to.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Bess said she wanted to grab a soda.&#x201d; I noticed that Payton looked slightly confused as she watched my two best friends approach. &#x201c;George is short for Georgia,&#x201d; I explained with a wink. &#x201c;But nobody calls her that unless they&#x2019;re trying to get under her skin.&#x201d;<br> <br>Payton nodded. &#x201c;Got it.&#x201d;<br> <br>By then Bess and George had reached us. Both had sodas, and George was also holding a paper cup of French fries smothered in ketchup. The scent of grease wafted toward me, temporarily overwhelming the pleasant horsey smell of Payton&#x2019;s mount.<br> <br>&#x201c;Payton Evans, George Fayne, Bess Marvin,&#x201d; Ned said, pointing at each girl in turn as he made the introductions. &#x201c;Bess and George are cousins, believe it or not,&#x201d; he added with a grin.<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you mean, believe it or not?&#x201d; Payton asked.<br> <br>I laughed. Bess and George may share the same family, but that&#x2019;s about all they have in common. Bess is blond, blue-eyed, and as girly as they come. George is, well, pretty much the opposite of that. For instance, Bess had dressed up to come to today&#x2019;s show in a pretty dress, stylish flats, even a matching bow holding back her shoulder-length hair. George? She was wearing what she wore just about every day. Jeans, T-shirt, and sneakers.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t pay any attention to him,&#x201d; Bess said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s nice to meet you, Payton.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So you&#x2019;re the superstar rider Ned keeps talking about,&#x201d; George added, popping a fry into her mouth. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s been totally geeking out about how you&#x2019;re probably going to be in the next Olympics. Is that true, or is he just pulling our legs?&#x201d;<br> <br>Payton played with the reins resting on her mount&#x2019;s withers. &#x201c;Actually, my trainer tells me the chef d&#x2019;�quipe of the US team is supposed to come watch the Grand Prix at this show.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The chef de what?&#x201d; Bess asked as she reached over and snagged one of George&#x2019;s fries.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the person in charge of the Olympic team,&#x201d; Ned explained. &#x201c;Mom and Dad were talking about it last night after Payton&#x2019;s dad called to make final arrangements.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Wow,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;So this big-time Olympics head guy is coming to watch you ride? Maybe so he can decide if you should try out for the US team?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I guess so.&#x201d; Payton shrugged again. &#x201c;I mean, we don&#x2019;t know for sure that he&#x2019;s coming to see me in particular. But my trainer and my parents seem to think so.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Awesome.&#x201d; George reached out and tentatively patted Payton&#x2019;s horse on the nose. &#x201c;So is this the horse you&#x2019;ll be riding when he&#x2019;s watching?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No. I&#x2019;ll be riding my own horse&#x2014;my most experienced jumper. His name is Midnight.&#x201d; Payton smiled as she said the horse&#x2019;s name. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s really cool. Maybe you guys can meet him later.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;d love to,&#x201d; Bess said. &#x201c;As long as it&#x2019;s not too much later. Because I&#x2019;m sure Nancy and Ned have other plans this evening.&#x201d; She waggled her eyebrows at me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure we do,&#x201d; Ned said. &#x201c;My parents are throwing that barbecue tonight, remember? You&#x2019;re both invited.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, right.&#x201d; Bess pursed her lips. &#x201c;Okay, but that&#x2019;s not what I&#x2019;m talking about.&#x201d; She wagged a playful finger in Ned&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;I certainly hope you&#x2019;re planning to take Nancy somewhere more romantic than a family barbecue&#x2014;or a horse show&#x2014;this weekend. It&#x2019;s your anniversary, remember?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How could he forget? You&#x2019;ve only been reminding him twice a day for the past month.&#x201d; I was exaggerating, but only a little. Bess is nothing if not a romantic.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah. Give it a rest already,&#x201d; George told her cousin. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure Ned has it all under control.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course I do. I mean, what could be more romantic than this?&#x201d; Ned slipped one arm around my shoulders, helping himself to a couple of George&#x2019;s fries with the other hand. &#x201c;Fried food, horse manure&#x2014;what more could any girl want?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Heads up!&#x201d; a voice barked out, cutting through our laughter. It was another rider&#x2014;a sharp-chinned teenage girl on a lanky gray horse. The horse was cantering straight at Payton and her mount!<br> <br>Payton glanced over her shoulder, then shifted her horse aside just in time to avoid a collision. &#x201c;Um, sorry,&#x201d; she called to the other rider, even though from where I stood it looked as if the gray horse was the one at fault.<br> <br>The gray horse&#x2019;s rider pulled him to a halt and glared back over her shoulder. &#x201c;Is this your first horse show, Payton?&#x201d; she snapped. &#x201c;This is supposed to be a warm-up ring. If you want to stand around and gossip, do it somewhere else.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; Payton said again, though the other rider was already spurring her horse back into a canter.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nice girl,&#x201d; George commented with a snort. &#x201c;Friend of yours?&#x201d;<br> <br>Payton sighed. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s Jessica. I don&#x2019;t even know her that well&#x2014;she rides at a barn a few miles from mine, and we end up at most of the same shows. I have no idea why she doesn&#x2019;t like me, but she&#x2019;s never exactly made a secret of it.&#x201d; She grimaced and gathered up her reins. &#x201c;But she&#x2019;s right about one thing&#x2014;I shouldn&#x2019;t be standing around. I&#x2019;d better get back to my warm-up. I&#x2019;ll see you guys later, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure. Good luck,&#x201d; Bess said.<br> <br>We watched her ride off. &#x201c;She seems nice,&#x201d; I said to Ned.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, she is.&#x201d; Ned reached for another fry despite George&#x2019;s grumbles. &#x201c;Our moms try to get together as often as they can, so I&#x2019;ve known Payton for a long time. Haven&#x2019;t seen her in two or three years, though.&#x201d; He licked the salt off his fingers. &#x201c;Her parents both have pretty intense jobs. Mr. Evans is some kind of high-powered financier, and Payton&#x2019;s mom is a medical researcher at one of the top hospitals in Chicago.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Wow.&#x201d; George whistled. &#x201c;Impressive.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah. And I guess what they say is true&#x2014;the apple doesn&#x2019;t fall far from the tree. Because Payton&#x2019;s kind of intense herself.&#x201d; Ned glanced out toward the ring. &#x201c;Her parents say she started begging for riding lessons when she was about three or four, and she&#x2019;s spent every possible minute in the saddle since. I guess it&#x2019;s no wonder people are starting to talk about the Olympics.&#x201d;<br> <br>Turning to follow his gaze, I saw Payton cantering the big bay horse near the center of the ring, where several jumps were set up. Her face was scrunched up with concentration as she steered around the other riders going every which way. As I watched, she aimed her mount at the highest of the jumps. I held my breath as the horse sailed over easily.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nice,&#x201d; Bess said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; I agreed. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t wait to see her compete. How long until it&#x2019;s her turn?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure.&#x201d; Ned glanced at the gate a short distance away. A steady stream of riders had been going in and out the whole time we&#x2019;d been standing there.<br> <br>&#x201c;I guess you&#x2019;ll have to follow the clues to figure it out, Nancy,&#x201d; George joked.<br> <br>I grinned. My friends like to tease me about my recreational sleuthing. But the truth is, they seem to like it just as much as I do. At least they never complain when I drag them into yet another case. Not much, anyway.<br> <br>We all watched Payton and her horse glide easily over another jump. As she landed, I caught a flurry of activity immediately behind where my friends and I were standing. Glancing over my shoulder, I saw a woman striding in our direction. She was petite and deeply tanned, with close-cropped reddish-blond hair a few shades darker than my own. As she rushed past us to the rail, the woman was so focused on the activity in the ring that she almost knocked Bess&#x2019;s soda out of her hand.<br> <br>&#x201c;Payton!&#x201d; she hollered. Her voice was surprisingly loud for such a small person, cutting easily through the clamor of the warm-up ring. &#x201c;Over here&#x2014;now!&#x201d;<br> <br>Soon Payton was riding over again. &#x201c;Dana!&#x201d; she said breathlessly. &#x201c;I thought you were going to meet me at the in-gate.&#x201d; She glanced at us. &#x201c;So did you meet Ned and his friends? Guys, this is my trainer, Dana Kinney.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Huh?&#x201d; Dana barely spared us a glance and a curt nod. &#x201c;Listen, Payton, we need to talk&#x2014;now.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; Payton checked her watch. &#x201c;I was about to leave for the ring&#x2014;I&#x2019;m on deck, I think.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then I&#x2019;ll make this quick.&#x201d; Dana clenched her fists at her sides, staring up at Payton. &#x201c;One of the show stewards just received an anonymous tip about you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;About me?&#x201d; Payton looked confused. &#x201c;What do you mean? What kind of tip?&#x201d;<br> <br>Dana scowled. &#x201c;Whoever it is, they&#x2019;re claiming that you drug all your horses!&#x201d;</p>
